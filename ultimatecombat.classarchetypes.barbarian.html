<p>The barbarian is a creature of savagery and superstition. Whether tapping into totems of power or unleashing mighty reserves of rage and destruction, a barbarian lives in a world of battle, a place of barely controlled emotion and unrelenting bloodshed.</p>
<p>Presented here are a number of new barbarian rage powers and archetypes that allow a barbarian to tap into new sources of savage power, expanding your choices when building such characters and providing different types of barbarians for you to play. Many of the new rage powers increase already published rage powers. Others are brand new, providing new manifestations of a barbarian’s powerful rages.</p>
<p>The new barbarian archetypes also suggest rage powers—though not mandatory, these choices complement the theme and the features of each archetype.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-rage-powers"><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: Any barbarian who meets the powers’ prerequisites can select and use the following new rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with “dragon totem” in its title).</p>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-auspicious-mark">
<div><em>Auspicious Mark (Su)</em>: The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. Once per rage, as a swift action that costs 2 rounds of rage, the barbarian can call upon the spirits’ favor. Using auspicious mark grants her a +1d6 bonus on one d20 roll she has just made. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-bestial-climber">
<div><em>Bestial Climber (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains a natural climb speed equal to her land speed. A barbarian must have the raging climber rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-bestial-leaper">
<div><em>Bestial Leaper (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian can take a move action to move and can take her normal standard action at any point during the move. A barbarian must have the raging leaper rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-bestial-swimmer">
<div><em>Bestial Swimmer (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains a natural swim speed equal to her normal land speed. A barbarian must have the raging swimmer rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-bleeding-blow">
<div><em>Bleeding Blow (Ex)</em>: When she uses her powerful blow rage power, the barbarian also deals bleed damage equal to her bonus damage with the powerful blow. This bleed damage bypasses damage reduction. A barbarian must have the powerful blow rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-body-bludgeon">
<div><em>Body Bludgeon (Ex)</em>: While raging, if the barbarian pins an opponent that is smaller than her, she can then use that opponent as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage, assuming the opponent is sized Small. Larger or smaller creatures used as a bludgeon deal damage based on their size using this base damage. A size Tiny creature deals 1d6 points of damage, a size Medium creature deals 1d10 points of damage, and so on. The barbarian can make a single attack using the pinned opponent as part of the action she uses to maintain the grapple, using her highest attack bonus. Whenever the barbarian hits using the pinned opponent as a weapon, she deals damage to her target normally, and the grappled opponent used as a bludgeon also takes the same damage she dealt to the target. If the pinned opponent is unable to resist being pinned for any reason, the barbarian can use that opponent as an improvised weapon without grappling or pinning the opponent, until the creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, at which point the creature becomes useless as an improvised weapon. A barbarian must be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-crippling-blow">
<div><em>Crippling Blow (Ex)</em>: When using her powerful blow rage power, the barbarian can forgo the normal bonus to damage (including any bleed damage granted by the bleeding blow rage power or similar boosts to the damage of the powerful blow rage power) and instead deals 1 point of ability damage to the target’s Strength or Dexterity score for every four class levels the barbarian has attained. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) to halve this ability damage. A barbarian must have the powerful blow rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-deadly-accuracy">
<div><em>Deadly Accuracy (Ex)</em>: If the barbarian scores a critical threat when using her surprise accuracy rage power, she applies double the surprise accuracy bonus when rolling to confirm the critical. A barbarian must have the surprise accuracy rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-dragon-totem-su">
<div><em>Dragon Totem (Su):</em> The barbarian must select a single color of dragon (black, blue, brass, bronze, copper, gold, green, red, silver, or white) as her totem. While raging, she gains a +1 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> checks and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear, paralysis, and sleep effects. This bonus increases by +1 for each additional dragon totem rage power (such as dragon totem resilience and dragon totem wings) the barbarian possesses. A barbarian must have the animal fury and intimidating glare rage powers and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-dragon-totem-resilience">
<div><em>Dragon Totem Resilience (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to the energy type that is associated with her dragon totem—acid (black, copper, green), cold (silver, white), electricity (blue, bronze), or fire (brass, gold, red). This resistance equals double her current DR/— from her barbarian damage reduction class feature; this DR increases by 2 for each dragon totem rage power she possesses, including this one. A barbarian must have the dragon totem rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-dragon-totem-wings">
<div><em>Dragon Totem Wings (Su)</em>: When a barbarian selects this rage power, the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.fly.html#corerulebook-skills-fly-fly"><span class="std std-ref">Fly</span></a> (Dex) skill becomes a class skill for her. While raging and wearing medium or lighter armor, the barbarian can spend a standard action to manifest a pair of spiritual dragon wings that grant her a fly speed equal to her base speed (average maneuverability). She can expend 2 rounds of her rage to instead spend an immediate action to gain this fly speed. She can end her fly speed at any time, even when it is not her turn. Each round she spends raging and flying counts as 2 rounds of rage. Her ability to fly ends automatically when she ceases raging. A barbarian must have the dragon totem and dragon totem resilience rage powers, and she must be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-eater-of-magic">
<div><em>Eater of Magic (Su)</em>: Once per rage, when a barbarian fails a saving throw against a spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability, she can reroll the saving throw against the effect (this is not an action). If she succeeds at the second saving throw, she is not affected by the spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability and gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the effect’s caster level (in the case of spell or spell-like abilities) or the CR of the effect’s creator (in the case of supernatural abilities). These temporary hit points last until damage is applied to them or 1 minute, whichever occurs first. A barbarian must have the superstition rage power and be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-ghost-rager">
<div><em>Ghost Rager (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian deals normal damage to incorporeal creatures even when using nonmagical weapons. She also gains a +3 morale bonus to touch AC, which increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +7 at 20th level). This can’t raise her touch AC above her full AC. A barbarian must be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-ground-breaker-greater">
<div><em>Ground Breaker, Greater (Ex)</em>: When using the ground breaker rage power, the barbarian can extend the radius of the effect by 5 feet. This rage power can be selected up to three times, and its effects stack. A barbarian must have the ground breaker rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-guarded-life-greater">
<div><em>Guarded Life, Greater (Ex)</em>: When using the guarded life rage power, 1 additional hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage.

She also gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD when grappling for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5).

<div><em>Hive Totem Toxicity (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian increases her bite damage die type with the animal fury rage power by one die type and decreases the penalty on attack rolls with that bite to –2. Once per rage, a bite that hits can deliver an injury toxin that has a frequency of once per round for 4 rounds, deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage, and has a cure of one save. The saving throw has a Fortitude save DC of 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier.

<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-jotungrip"><strong>Jotungrip (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a titan mauler may choose to wield a two-handed weapon in one hand with a –2 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. The weapon must be appropriately sized for her, and it is treated as one-handed when determining the effect of <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#power attack (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Power Attack</span></a>, Strength bonus to damage, and the like. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-massive-weapons"><strong>Massive Weapons (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a titan mauler becomes skilled in the use of massive weapons looted from her titanic foes. She can use two-handed weapons meant for creatures one size category larger, but the penalty for doing so is increased by 4. However, the attack roll penalty for using weapons too large for her size is reduced by 1, and this reduction increases by 1 for every three levels beyond 3rd (to a minimum of 0). This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-evade-reach"><strong>Evade Reach (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, as a swift action, a titan mauler may choose one creature within her line of sight. Until the end of her turn, that target’s reach is treated as if it were 5 feet shorter with respect to reaching the titan mauler, and this reduction increases by 5 feet for every five levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-titanic-rage"><strong>Titanic Rage (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, a titan mauler may choose to gain the benefits of <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson.html#corerulebook-spells-enlargeperson-enlarge-person"><span class="std std-ref">enlarge person</span></a> when she enters a rage. While using titanic rage, she must spend 2 rounds of rage per round, and she becomes exhausted rather than fatigued when the rage ends. This ability replaces indomitable will.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the titan mauler archetype: body bludgeon, greater ground breaker, ground breaker, knockback, mighty swing, powerful blow, smasher, and strength surge.</p>

<span id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-true-primitive-archetype"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">True Primitive (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#true-primitive-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Isolated and xenophobic tribes that dwell in areas untouched by civilization often see anything from cities and organized settlements as strange, dangerous, and decadent. They gain power from their truly primitive nature; their bodies and spirits are hardened by the wild and untainted existence far from the pathetic softness of so-called civilization. Even when forced to mingle with civilization, the true primitive stays apart in both traditions and trappings.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A true primitive is proficient with hide armor and armors made from bone. A true primitive is also proficient with bone shields and the following weapons: battleaxe, blowgun, club, greatclub, handaxe, longspear, shortspear, sling, and spear.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-illiteracy"><strong>Illiteracy</strong>: A true primitive cannot read or write, and her superstition about such things leads her to refuse to ever learn to read or write, even if she multiclasses into other classes.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-favored-terrain"><strong>Favored Terrain (Ex)</strong>: A true primitive has a favored terrain representing her native homeland. This ability functions as the ranger class feature, and the true primitive’s bonuses in that terrain improve by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. However, she does not gain any additional favored terrains. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-trophy-fetish"><strong>Trophy Fetish (Ex)</strong>: A true primitive collects teeth, bones, hair, and other trophies from vanquished enemies, representing their power and strength. At 3rd level, a true primitive can attach a trophy fetish to one of the traditional true primitive weapons listed above. When wielding that weapon, the true primitive gains a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls. Furthermore, if that weapon has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can ignore the effects of a single natural 1 roll. A trophy fetish can also be attached to a suit of hide or bone armor, granting the true primitive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. Furthermore, if that armor has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can chose not to have the armor break on the confirmation of a critical hit made against her. Every five levels beyond 3rd, a true primitive can use an additional trophy fetish. Multiple trophy fetishes can be attached to the same armor or weapon; their effects stack. A trophy fetish can be sundered (hardness 5, 1 hit point) but is not damaged by area attacks or attacks that do not specifically target it. It has no effect if attached to other types of weapons or armor. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the true primitive archetype: animal fury, eater of magic, ghost rager, low-light vision, night vision, primal scent, scent, spell sunder, sunder enchantment, superstition, and witch hunter.</p>

<div class="section" id="urban-barbarian-archetype">
<span id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-urban-barbarian-archetype"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Urban Barbarian (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#urban-barbarian-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Every barbarian knows that city life can soften the spirit and the body, but some barbarians take on the trappings and ways of their adoptive homes and bend their savage powers to its challenges. While these urban barbarians’ rough edges are smoothed into civility, they can use their primal nature and upbringing to move with the ebb and flow of civilization’s natural rhythms.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An urban barbarian is not proficient with medium armor.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-skills"><strong>Skills</strong>: An urban barbarian does not gain <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.handleanimal.html#corerulebook-skills-handleanimal-handle-animal"><span class="std std-ref">Handle Animal</span></a> (Cha), <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (nature) (Int), or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.survival.html#corerulebook-skills-survival-survival"><span class="std std-ref">Survival</span></a> (Wis) as class skills; instead, she gains <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.diplomacy.html#corerulebook-skills-diplomacy-diplomacy"><span class="std std-ref">Diplomacy</span></a> (Cha), <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (local) (Int), <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (nobility) (Int), <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.linguistics.html#corerulebook-skills-linguistics-linguistics"><span class="std std-ref">Linguistics</span></a> (Int), and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.profession.html#corerulebook-skills-profession-profession"><span class="std std-ref">Profession</span></a> (Wis) as class skills.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-crowd-control"><strong>Crowd Control (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, an urban barbarian gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC when adjacent to two or more enemies. In addition, her movement is not impeded by crowds, and she gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her barbarian level on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> checks to influence crowds. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-controlled-rage"><strong>Controlled Rage (Ex)</strong>: When an urban barbarian rages, instead of making a normal rage she applies a +4 morale bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater rage and +8 when she gains mighty rage. She may apply the full bonus to one ability score or may split the bonus between several scores in increments of +2. When using a controlled rage, an urban barbarian gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills. This ability otherwise follows the normal rules for rage. This ability alters rage.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the urban barbarian archetype: boasting taunt, clear mind, deadly accuracy, guarded stance, intimidating glare, lethal accuracy, no escape, quick reflexes, perfect clarity, sharpened accuracy, surprise accuracy, and unexpected strike.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wild-rager-archetype">
<span id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-wild-rager-archetype"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Wild Rager (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#wild-rager-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Rages are barely controlled, but there are those who wholly give in to their more savage side, letting their rages take them to a confusing and uncontrolled place of terrible savagery. These barbarians become beasts, consumed with absolute bloodlust to the point where they cannot tell friend from foe.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-uncontrolled-rage"><strong>Uncontrolled Rage (Ex)</strong>: A wild rager’s rage functions as normal, except that when she reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, she must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) or become confused. For the remainder of her current turn, she attacks the nearest creature other than herself. On the following round, refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.confusion.html#corerulebook-spells-confusion-confusion"><span class="std std-ref">confusion</span></a> spell to determine her actions. At the end of this round, and each round thereafter, she can attempt a new saving throw to end the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.confusion.html#corerulebook-spells-confusion-confusion"><span class="std std-ref">confusion</span></a> effect. The rounds during which she is confused do not count against the rounds she has spent raging that day, but she cannot end her rage voluntarily, nor can she use rage powers while confused.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-wild-fighting"><strong>Wild Fighting (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, even when not raging, wild ragers often fight with reckless, savage abandon. A wild rager using the full-attack action can make one extra attack per round at her highest base attack bonus. Until the beginning of her next turn, however, she takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and –4 penalty to AC. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-barbarian-rage-conversion"><strong>Rage Conversion (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a wild rager who fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting effect can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of her next turn. If the save succeeds, that effect ends and she instead rages and becomes confused as noted above. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the wild rager archetype: animal fury, bloody blow, body bludgeon, brawler, crippling blow, greater brawler, intimidating glare, mighty swing, no escape, powerful blow, and quick reflexes.</p>
