<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 7</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, F (a miniature ivory door, a piece of polished marble, and a silver spoon, each worth 5 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 2 hours/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-spell-resistance"><span class="std std-ref">Spell Resistance</span></a> no</p>
<p>You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-invisible"><span class="std std-ref">invisible</span></a> behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p>
<p>You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <em>unseen servant</em>spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.</p>
<p>Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p>
