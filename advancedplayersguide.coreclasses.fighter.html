<p>The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block, tip, and distract his opponents.

<p>A shielded fighter focuses on both offense and defense, blending weapon and shield in perfect balance to impede his enemies while delivering deadly blows, and even turning the shield itself into a formidable weapon. These fighting school benefits apply when wielding a weapon and a shield simultaneously.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-fighter-active-defense"><strong>Active Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a shielded fighter gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when wielding a shield and fighting defensively, using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#combat expertise (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Combat Expertise</span></a>, or using total defense. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-fighter-shield-guard"><strong>Shield Guard (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, as a swift action, a shielded fighter may designate one square adjacent to him. He may designate two squares if using a heavy shield or three squares if using a tower shield, but these squares must be contiguous. Enemies in these squares cannot flank the shielded fighter and do not count for flanking with other creatures. This effect lasts until he moves from his position or uses another swift action to change the affected squares. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-fighter-shield-mastery"><strong>Shield Mastery (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, a shielded fighter gains DR 5/— when wielding a shield. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
