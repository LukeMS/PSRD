<p>Humans whose ancestry includes beings of elemental fire such as efreet, ifrits are a passionate and fickle race. No ifrit is satisfied with a sedentary life; like a wildfire, ifrits must keep moving or burn away into nothingness. Ifrits not only adore flames, but personify multiple aspects of them as well, embodying both fire’s dynamic, ever-changing energy and its destructive, pitiless nature.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>: Ifrits vary in appearance as widely as their elemental ancestors do. Most have pointy ears, red or mottled horns on the brow, and hair that flickers and waves as if it were aflame. Some possess skin the color of polished brass or have charcoal-hued scales covering their arms and legs. Ifrits favor revealing and ostentatious clothing in bright oranges and reds, preferably paired with gaudy jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>Society</strong>: Ifrits are most often born into human communities, and rarely form societies of their own. Those who grow up in a city are almost always imprisoned or driven off before they reach adulthood; most are simply too hot-headed and independent to fit into civilized society, and their predilection toward pyromania doesn’t endear them to the local authorities. Those born into nomadic or tribal societies fare much better, since ifrits’ instinctive urge to explore and conquer their surroundings can easily earn them a place among their tribe’s leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Relations</strong>: Even the best-natured ifrits tend to view other individuals as tools to use as they see fit, and as such they get along best with races they can charm or browbeat into submission. Half-elves and gnomes often find themselves caught up in an ifrit’s schemes, while halflings, half-orcs, and dwarves usually bridle at ifrits’ controlling nature. Strangely, ifrits sometimes form incredibly close bonds with elves, whose calm, aloof nature seems to counterbalance an ifrit’s impulsiveness. Most ifrits refuse to associate with sylphs, but are otherwise on peaceable terms with the other elemental-touched races.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>: Ifrits are a dichotomous people—on one hand, fiercely independent, and on the other, imperious and demanding. They are often accused of being morally impoverished, but their troublemaking behavior is rarely motivated by true malice. Ifrits are usually lawful neutral or chaotic neutral, with a few falling into true neutrality. Most ifrits lack the mindset to follow a god’s teachings, and resent the strictures placed on them by organized faith. When ifrits do take to worship (usually venerating a fire-related deity), they prove to be zealous and devoted followers.</p>
<p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: Ifrits adventure for the sheer thrill of it and for the chance to test their skill against worthy foes, but most of all they adventure in search of power. Once ifrits dedicate themselves to a task, they pursue it unflinchingly, never stopping to consider the dangers ahead of them. When this brashness finally catches up with them, ifrits often rely on sorcery or bardic magic to combat their resulting troubles.</p>
<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Aja, Denat, Efit, Elum, Jalij, Maqej, Urah.</p>
<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Alayi, Etwa, Maqan, Qari, Sami, Zetaya.</p>

<p>The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing ifrit racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-desert-mirage"><strong>Desert Mirage</strong>: Ifrits thrive in the deserts of the world, where their keen instincts and resistance to heat give them a huge edge over their competitors. Those with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.stealth.html#corerulebook-skills-stealth-stealth"><span class="std std-ref">Stealth</span></a> checks in desert environments and on saves to resist starvation and thirst. This racial trait replaces fire affinity.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-efreeti-magic"><strong>Efreeti Magic</strong>: Some ifrits inherit an efreeti ancestor’s ability to magically change a creature’s size. They can cast either <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson.html#corerulebook-spells-enlargeperson-enlarge-person"><span class="std std-ref">enlarge person</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.reduceperson.html#corerulebook-spells-reduceperson-reduce-person"><span class="std std-ref">reduce person</span></a> (the ifrit chooses when using this ability) once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the ifrit’s level). The ifrit can use this ability to affect other ifrits as though they were humanoid creatures. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-fire-in-the-blood"><strong>Fire in the Blood</strong>: Ifrits with this racial trait mimic the healing abilities of the mephits, gaining fast healing 2 for 1 round anytime they take fire damage (whether or not this fire damage gets through their fire resistance). The ifrits can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function. This racial trait replaces fire affinity.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-fire-insight"><strong>Fire Insight</strong>: Ifrit spellcasters sometimes find that their elemental heritage makes creatures of fire more willing to serve them. <em>Summon monster</em> and <em>summon nature’s ally</em> spells that the ifrit casts last 2 rounds longer than normal when used to summon creatures with the fire subtype. This racial trait replaces fire affinity.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-fire-starter"><strong>Fire-Starter</strong>: Ifrits with this racial trait derive sadistic satisfaction from watching others burn. Anytime the ifrit causes a creature to catch fire, he gains a +1 morale bonus on the next single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check that he makes in the next round. The ifrit only gains this bonus the first time he causes a particular creature to catch fire; subsequent times the creature catches fire provide no bonus. This racial trait replaces fire affinity.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-forge-hardened"><strong>Forge-Hardened</strong>: Not all ifrits are descended from efreet—some instead descend from azers or even salamanders. Such ifrits gain a +2 racial bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.craft.html#corerulebook-skills-craft-craft"><span class="std std-ref">Craft</span></a> (armor and weapons) checks and saves to resist fatigue and exhaustion. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-hypnotic"><strong>Hypnotic</strong>: Ifrits with this racial trait evoke the entrancing nature of flame, adding +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells or effects they cast that inflict the fascinated condition. Once per day, when a creature rolls a saving throw against such an effect from the ifrit, the ifrit can spend an immediate action to force that creature to reroll the saving throw and use the second result, even if it is worse. The ifrit must announce he is using this ability before the results of the first roll are revealed. This racial trait replaces fire affinity.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-wildfire-heart"><strong>Wildfire Heart</strong>: Ifrits with this trait are as swift and dangerous as a blazing wildfire. They gain a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="favored-class-options">
<span id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-favored-class-options"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Favored Class Options</a><a class="headerlink" href="#favored-class-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following options are available to all ifrits who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the class reward.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-alchemist"><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Add +1/2 to the alchemist’s bomb damage.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-bard"><strong>Bard</strong>: Add +1/6 to the number of people the bard can affect with the fascinate bardic performance.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-cleric"><strong>Cleric</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (planes) checks relating to the Plane of Fire and creatures with the fire subtype.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-gunslinger"><strong>Gunslinger</strong>: Add +1/2 to the bonus on initiative checks the gunslinger makes while using her gunslinger initiative deed.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-inquisitor"><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> checks made against creatures with the fire subtype and a +1/2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (planes) checks relating to the Plane of Fire.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-oracle"><strong>Oracle</strong>: Add +1/6 to the oracle’s level for the purpose of determining the effects of one revelation.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-rogue"><strong>Rogue</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.acrobatics.html#corerulebook-skills-acrobatics-acrobatics"><span class="std std-ref">Acrobatics</span></a> checks to jump and a +1/2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> checks to demoralize enemies.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-sorcerer"><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Choose a bloodline power from the elemental (fire) bloodline or the efreeti bloodline  that the sorcerer can use. The sorcerer treats her class level as though it were +1/6 higher (to a maximum of +2) when determining the effects of that power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="racial-archetypes">
<span id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-racial-archetypes"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Racial Archetypes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#racial-archetypes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following racial archetypes are available to ifrits.</p>
<div class="section" id="immolator-inquisitor">
<span id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-immolator-inquisitor"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Immolator (Inquisitor)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#immolator-inquisitor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The immolator puts her pyromaniacal urges to work in the service of a deity. She brings burning retribution down upon the enemies of her faith, consigning their souls to the sacrificial flames. An immolator has the following class features.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-servant-of-the-flame"><strong>Servant of the Flame</strong>: An immolator must worship a deity whose portfolio includes the Fire domain. An immolator who selects the Fire domain (or one of its associated subdomains, if available) uses her domain powers at +1 caster level (this stacks with the ifrit’s fire affinity racial trait).</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-judgment"><strong>Judgment (Su)</strong>: An immolator gains the following judgment instead of the smiting judgment.</p>
<blockquote id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-immolation">
<div><em>Immolation</em>: The immolator channels purifying flame to consume her enemies. When dealing fire damage to an opponent, she treats the target’s fire resistance as 5 lower than normal (minimum 0). At 6th level, she treats the target’s resistance as 10 lower than normal, 15 lower than normal at 11th level, and 20 lower than normal at 16th level.</div></blockquote>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-burnt-offering"><strong>Burnt Offering (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, as a swift action, an immolator can imbue one of her weapons with the&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.magicitems.weapons.html#corerulebook-magicitems-weapons-weapons-flaming"><span class="std std-ref">flaming</span></a>&nbsp;weapon special ability. Any creature slain by this weapon burns with magical flame; its body turns to ash, though its equipment is not harmed. This special ability only functions while the immolator wields the weapon. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the immolator’s level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 12th level, this ability gives the immolator’s weapon the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.magicitems.weapons.html#corerulebook-magicitems-weapons-weapons-flaming-burst"><span class="std std-ref">flaming burst</span></a> weapon special ability. This ability replaces bane and greater bane.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-judgment-by-fire"><strong>Judgment by Fire (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, an immolator can call fiery judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an immolator uses her judgment ability, she can invoke a judgment by fire on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the immolator can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, the attack deals fire damage instead of weapon damage, and the target must make a successful Fortitude save or die (creatures immune to fire do not have to save). The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the immolator’s level + the immolator’s Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the immolator’s judgment by fire ability for 24 hours. Creatures killed in this manner explode in a burst of fire, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to every creature within 5 feet (Reflex save for half damage, DC 10 + 1/2 the immolator’s level + the immolator’s Wisdom modifier). Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. This ability modifies and functions as true judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wishcrafter-sorcerer">
<span id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-wishcrafter-sorcerer"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Wishcrafter (Sorcerer)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#wishcrafter-sorcerer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wishcrafters are born with a talent for manipulating reality inherited from their efreeti ancestors. However, like the genies they are descended from, wishcrafters can only draw upon this power to fulfill the desires of others. A wishcrafter has the following class features.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-wishbound-arcana"><strong>Wishbound Arcana (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, the wishcrafter can use the wishes of non-genie creatures other than herself in place of the normal verbal components of her spells. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the wishcrafter’s turn. The wishcrafter must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn’t normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn’t need to mention the name of a specific spell, but must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the wishcrafter knows (for example, wishing to be bigger could supply the verbal component for <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson.html#corerulebook-spells-enlargeperson-enlarge-person"><span class="std std-ref">enlarge person</span></a>). A wishcrafter gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature’s wish as a verbal component in this manner, but cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than a target or targets. A wishcrafter is under no compulsion to grant a creature’s wish. Once the wishcrafter grants a creature’s wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-expanded-wishcraft"><strong>Expanded Wishcraft</strong>: At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the wishcrafter grows more adept at altering reality to fit the whims of others. She may add an additional spell selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be one level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. A wishcrafter can only use these spells in conjunction with her wishbound arcana ability. For example, if she used this ability to learn <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.catsgrace.html#cat's grace"><span class="std std-ref">cat’s grace</span></a>, she can only cast it when another creature wishes for it, and can’t cast it on herself because it is a targeted spell. She cannot use these spells to craft or recharge magic items. These bonus spells replace the bloodline spells gained by the sorcerer’s bloodline.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-hearts-desire"><strong>Heart’s Desire (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, as a swift action, a wishcrafter can force a single creature within 30 feet to confess its deepest desire. The target receives a Will save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 the wishcrafter’s level + the wishcrafter’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature must immediately wish aloud in a clear voice for something it truly desires, allowing the wishcrafter to activate her wishbound arcana ability if she knows a spell that can fulfill that wish. This is a mind-affecting effect. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the same wishcrafter’s heart’s desire ability again for 24 hours. The wishcrafter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 7th level.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-twisted-wish"><strong>Twisted Wish (Su)</strong>: At 13th level, a wishcrafter becomes adept at corrupting wishes to negatively affect the creature that wished them. When a wishcrafter affects a creature with a spell using its wish as a spell component, she may twist the wish, applying a –4 penalty to the creature’s saving throws against the spell. The effects of wishes twisted this way are difficult to remove; the DC of caster level checks to dispel them increases by 5. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 13th level.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-perfect-wishcraft"><strong>Perfect Wishcraft (Su)</strong>: At 19th level, the wishcrafter perfects her ability to manipulate reality. Once per day, she may cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on her list of spells known. Using this ability otherwise has all of the benefits and limitations of the wishbound arcana ability. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 19th level.</p>

<p>The following options are available to ifrits. At the GM’s discretion, other appropriate races may make use of some of these new rules.</p>
<div class="section" id="ifrit-equipment">
<span id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-ifrit-equipment"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Ifrit Equipment</a><a class="headerlink" href="#ifrit-equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ifrits have access to the following equipment.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-fire-ink"><strong>Fire Ink</strong>: This rich yellow ink reacts with a creature’s body heat to create a flickering, flamelike glow. It takes 10 minutes to apply fire ink, and 1 dose covers an approximately hand-sized area. Once applied, the ink glows as a candle for 24 hours. Four or more doses applied to the same part of the body glow as a torch for 24 hours. The alchemical reaction of the ink to the target’s skin and body heat is painful and irritating, giving the target the sickened condition while the glow lasts. A DC 15 <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.heal.html#corerulebook-skills-heal-heal"><span class="std std-ref">Heal</span></a> check can temporarily soothe these sensations, negating the sickened condition for 1 hour. Creatures immune or resistant to fire are immune to this sickening effect. Ifrits are especially known for their fondness for fire ink, and ifrit fire-dancers often decorate their skin with flaming designs before performing. A concentrated version of the ink costs 10 times as much and can be used to make permanently glowing tattoos.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-featuredraces-ifrits-ifrits-blood"><strong>Ifrit’s Blood</strong>: Ifrit alchemists claim to make this thick red oil from their own blood—hence the morbid name—but this claim is almost certainly false. Ifrit’s blood ignites upon contact with air, but burns slowly and is unsuitable for use as a splash weapon. A creature can apply a flask of ifrit’s blood to a weapon as a standard action, wreathing the weapon in vibrant red flames for 1 minute. The oil deals 1 point of fire damage on each successful attack with the weapon and deals 1 point of fire damage to the weapon itself, bypassing the weapon’s hardness if any part of it is made of wood. If the oil is applied to a creature’s natural weapons or unarmed strikes, the creature takes 1 point of fire damage each round (though its fire immunity or resistance still applies).</p>

<p>This thick leather cloak is charred and blackened around the edges and smells faintly of soot. Once per day, when subject to an effect that deals fire damage, the wearer can spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of ashes and bones, as if he had been slain by the fire effect. The invisibility and the illusory remains last for 5 rounds or until the wearer attacks any creature. Creatures that study or interact with the ashes can make a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the illusion, though this does not end the invisibility effect.</p>
