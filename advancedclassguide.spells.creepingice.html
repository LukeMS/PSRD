<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [cold]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>This spell covers the floor, the ground, or some other calm horizontal surface (such as a placid lake or a gentle river) with a sheet of slowly growing ice. The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water.</p>
<p>Each 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is 15 + your caster level.</p>
<p>Each round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is slow enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature’s square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square.</p>
