<p>The true barbarian is a creature of bestial, savage fury. Whether a stoic tribal champion who whips herself into a berserker frenzy for the good of her sword-sisters, or a chaotic warrior who revels in carnage for its own sake, all barbarians share a similar approach to combat. Once the red haze of bloodlust descends, there is only a burning rage that carries them through the screaming fray, heedless of wounds and leaving scattered corpses in their wake.</p>
<p>Presented below are a number of new rage powers to help you customize your barbarian, as well as several classic barbarian archetypes to help you in building your character, each one including a number of suggested rage powers that, while not mandatory, work to flesh out the character concept. Rage powers marked with an asterisk ( *) can be found in the <em>PRD Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-rage-powers"><strong>Rage Powers (Ex)</strong>: The following new rage powers can be taken by any barbarian that meets the prerequisites. Totem rage powers grant powers in a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian that selects a beast totem rage power cannot later chose to gain any of the spirit totem rage powers.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-beast-totem"><em>Beast Totem (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the barbarian has attained. A barbarian must have the lesser beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-beast-totem-greater"><em>Beast Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains the pounce special ability, allowing her to make a full attack at the end of a charge. In addition, the damage from her claws increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) and the claws deal ×3 damage on a critical hit. A barbarian must have the beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-beast-totem-lesser"><em>Beast Totem, Lesser (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at the barbarian’s full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if Small) plus the barbarian’s Strength modifier.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-boasting-taunt">Boasting <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats.html#advancedplayersguide-advancedfeats-taunt"><span class="std std-ref">Taunt</span></a> (Ex): While raging, the barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> check to demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-brawler"><em>Brawler</em>: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#improved unarmed strike (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Improved Unarmed Strike</span></a>.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-brawler-greater"><em>Brawler, Greater</em>: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#two-weapon fighting (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Two-Weapon Fighting</span></a> when making unarmed strike attacks. A barbarian must have the brawler rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-chaos-totem"><em>Chaos Totem (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian’s form becomes infused with chaos. She gains a +4 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.escapeartist.html#corerulebook-skills-escapeartist-escape-artist"><span class="std std-ref">Escape Artist</span></a> checks and has a 25% chance to ignore extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. A barbarian must have the lesser chaos totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-chaos-totem-greater"><em>Chaos Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains DR/lawful equal to 1/2 her barbarian level. Her weapons and natural weapons are considered chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A barbarian must have the chaos totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-chaos-totem-lesser"><em>Chaos Totem, Lesser (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC against the attacks of lawful creatures and a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against confusion, insanity, polymorph, and effects with the lawful descriptor. This bonus increases by +1 for each chaos totem rage power she possesses.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-come-and-get-me"><em>Come and Get Me (Ex)</em>: While raging, as a free action the barbarian may leave herself open to attack while preparing devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the barbarian until the beginning of her next turn, but every attack against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is resolved prior to resolving each enemy attack. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-disruptive"><a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#disruptive (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Disruptive</span></a>: When raging, the barbarian gains <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#disruptive (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Disruptive</span></a> as a bonus feat. The barbarian must have the superstition * rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-elemental-rage">Elemental <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.rage.html#corerulebook-spells-rage-rage"><span class="std std-ref">Rage</span></a> (Su): While raging, all of the barbarian’s melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The type is chosen when the barbarian begins her rage. A barbarian must have the lesser elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use her lesser elemental rage power while using this rage power, but she must select a different energy type.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-elemental-rage-greater">Elemental <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.rage.html#corerulebook-spells-rage-rage"><span class="std std-ref">Rage</span></a>, Greater (Su): While raging, all of the barbarian’s critical hits made with melee weapons deal an additional 1d10 points of energy damage (2d10 if the weapon deals ×3 damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals ×4 on a critical hit). The type of this damage is the same as the type chosen for the elemental rage power. A barbarian must have the elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-elemental-rage-lesser">Elemental <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.rage.html#corerulebook-spells-rage-rage"><span class="std std-ref">Rage</span></a>, Lesser (Su): As a swift action, the barbarian can cause her melee attacks to deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) for 1 round. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power. This power can only be used once per rage.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-energy-absorption"><em>Energy Absorption (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack of her chosen energy type once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it, instead gaining 1 temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of the barbarian’s rage. A barbarian must have the greater energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-energy-eruption"><em>Energy Eruption (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. The breath weapon inflicts damage equal to the damage from the attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did not allow a save. A barbarian must have the energy absorption rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 16th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-energy-resistance">Energy <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.resistance.html#corerulebook-spells-resistance-resistance"><span class="std std-ref">Resistance</span></a> (Ex): While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected and it cannot be changed. This rage power can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time is applies to a different energy type.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-energy-resistance-greater">Energy <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.resistance.html#corerulebook-spells-resistance-resistance"><span class="std std-ref">Resistance</span></a>, Greater (Ex): Once per rage, a barbarian can reduce damage by half from a single attack against which she has energy resistance (halve the damage, then apply resistance). A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-ferocious-mount">Ferocious <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.mount.html#corerulebook-spells-mount-mount"><span class="std std-ref">Mount</span></a> (Ex): While raging and mounted, the barbarian’s mount also gains the benefits of rage (including greater rage and mighty rage) as long as the barbarian is mounted or adjacent to it. While her mount is raging in this way, she must spend one additional round of rage per round. She can elect not to pay this cost, in which case her mount does not rage.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-ferocious-mount-greater">Ferocious <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.mount.html#corerulebook-spells-mount-mount"><span class="std std-ref">Mount</span></a>, Greater (Ex): While raging and mounted, the barbarian’s mount gains the benefits of any rage powers that are constant in effect when the barbarian is raging.

This attack inflicts 1d8 points of damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge mount, plus 1–1/2 times the mount’s Strength modifier. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the mount’s Strength modifier) halves this damage. Creatures in the mount’s path or that threaten squares it passes through may make attacks of opportunity against either the barbarian or the mount, but not both. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-ferocious-trample-greater">Ferocious <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#trample (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Trample</span></a>, Greater (Ex): A barbarian’s mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its ferocious trample.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-liquid-courage"><em>Liquid Courage (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian increases her morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects by +1 for each alcoholic drink she consumes during her rage, to a maximum of +1 increase per four barbarian levels.</p>

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-smasher"><em>Smasher (Ex)</em>: Once per rage, whenever the barbarian makes an attack against an unattended object or a sunder combat maneuver, she can ignore the object’s hardness.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-spirit-totem-greater"><em>Spirit Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian become dangerous to any enemy adjacent to the barbarian. Living enemies adjacent to the barbarian at the start of her turn take 1d8 points of negative energy damage. In addition, the spirit wisps can now attack foes that are up to 15 feet away from the barbarian and the slam attack deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage. A barbarian must have the spirit totem rage power and be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-spirit-totem-lesser"><em>Spirit Totem, Lesser (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian is surrounded by spirit wisps that harass her foes.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-battle-scavenger"><strong>Battle Scavenger (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the breaker barbarian suffers no penalty on attack rolls when using an improvised weapon or a weapon with the broken condition. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls with improvised or broken weapons for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>

<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-savage-grapple"><strong>Savage Grapple (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, the brutal pugilist takes only half the normal penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition. She can make an attack of opportunity against creatures trying to grapple her even if they possess the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#improved grapple (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Improved Grapple</span></a> feat or the grab special attack. If she hits with this attack of opportunity, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her CMD against the grapple attempt. She cannot make these attacks of opportunity once a grapple has succeeded. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-coreclasses-barbarian-pit-fighter"><strong>Pit Fighter (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the brutal pugilist has learned combat tricks from fighting in pit brawls and gladiatorial arenas.

At every three levels after 3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this bonus on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no more than twice, once on CMB and once to CMD. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
