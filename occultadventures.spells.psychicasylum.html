<p><strong>School</strong> illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> mesmerist 5, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 swift action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You retreat into a mindscape of your own making that allows you to perform a lengthy mental task in an instant. You create a mental landscape that provides succor and calm for you, such as a library, sitting room, garden, or childhood tree house. You can spend up to 15 minutes in your psychic asylum. While you are within, no time passes for your body, and when you emerge you can continue with your turn. The mindscape is overt, finite, and has a rapid passage of time.</p>
<p>While within the mindscape, you can consult any text, recall any conversation, or remember any image that you have been exposed to with perfect clarity and recollection, as if you had an eidetic memory. You must have seen or heard the material within a time frame of 1 week per level. For example, you might wish to reexamine a passage of text from an ancient manuscript you rapidly scanned in a library 2 weeks prior. While in the <em>psychic asylum</em>, you can perfectly recall the precise layout of the text within the ancient manuscript and read it word for word. Once you emerge from the <em>psychic asylum</em>, you can recall the details of what you had just studied as clearly as if you had just looked at it, but you no longer have total recall of the material.</p>
<p>If you’re able to prepare spells, you can use the time to prepare a single spell. For example, if you were poisoned, you could use your swift action to cast <em>psychic asylum</em>, pray and meditate for the full 15 minutes to gain <em>neutralize poison</em>, then emerge from the mindscape and immediately cast the spell upon yourself as your standard action.</p>
<p>Any mind-affecting spell that was affecting you before you cast the spell continues to expend its duration on you while you are within the <em>psychic asylum</em>, so you can use this spell to wait out the effects of such a condition. Effects that are currently affecting your body do not expend additional duration while you are in the <em>psychic asylum</em>, but you also don’t experience their effects during the time spent there.</p>
