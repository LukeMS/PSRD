<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy [language-dependent]; <strong>Level</strong> medium 0, occultist 0, psychic 0, spiritualist 0</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one dead creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but you can’t ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10% chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret).</p>
<p>Useful information may include warnings about dangers deeper in a dungeon, the command word to a magic item, or even vague and spectral warnings of your or your companions’ future. The GM decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.</p>
<p>Once a corpse has been subject to <em>grave words</em> by any caster, any new attempt to cast <em>grave words</em> on that corpse fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the head of the corpse must have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell doesn’t affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.</p>
