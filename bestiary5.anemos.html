<p><strong>Aerokinesis (Sp, Su)</strong> An anemos has access to a variety of air wild talents as if it were a 20th-level kineticist. As a being of pure wind, it can perform the air and electric simple blasts and the thunderstorm composite blast at no burn cost. The anemos gains infusions and utility talents listed under its other special abilities, but doesn’t gain any other abilities of a 20th-level kineticist.</p>
<p><strong>Earthbane</strong> An anemos’s windblessed ability and regeneration are suppressed whenever any part of the creature is submerged at least 1 inch into earth (including dirt, mud, or clay). While an anemos is airborne, only pure elemental earth attacks (like an earth simple blast or an earth elemental’s slam attack) can suppress the anemos’s regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Infusions (Su)</strong> An anemos has access to the kineticist form and substance infusions listed in its Special Attacks entry, which it can apply to any of the blasts granted by its aerokinesis ability without needing to accept burn. This applies to only the base burn cost; an anemos can’t accept additional burn to gain a greater effect with infusions such as pushing infusion.</p>
<p><strong>Manifest Thunderbolt (Su)</strong> An anemos’s spear is an actual thunderbolt, which it can form at will as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Utility Wild Talents (Sp, Su)</strong> An anemos gains access to the kineticist utility wild talents listed in its SQ entry.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Form (Ex)</strong> An anemos can cause its body to become more diffuse than normal, losing its human-shaped coherence and instead becoming a formless and invisible wind. When an anemos enters wind form, it automatically escapes from any grapples or bindings that managed to hold it despite its <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.freedomofmovement.html#corerulebook-spells-freedomofmovement-freedom-of-movement"><span class="std std-ref">freedom of movement</span></a>, and gains the natural invisibility ability, but can’t use aerokinesis or its spear attack.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Orchestra (Su)</strong> An anemos can use the winds themselves as wind instruments, which count as masterwork instruments for the purpose of its Perform (wind instruments) skill. It can use its winds to duplicate the effects of the countersong or dirge of doom bardic performances as if it were a bard with a number of rounds of bardic performance per day equal to its Charisma bonus. Beginning this performance is a swift action.</p>
<p><strong>Windblessed (Su)</strong> An anemos is like a god unto the wind, and the wind zealously protects it. It gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. An anemos is never affected by winds or weather effects unless it chooses to be.</p>
<p>Anemoi are godlike beings from the Plane of Air, masters of the storm and sky. While an anemos appears humanoid in shape, even a cursory glance reveals that its humanlike appearance is a complete facade, for its 6-foot-tall body is composed of solidified air, has no vital organs, and is nearly weightless. The winds themselves obey an anemos, and greater sky deities often task four anemoi with controlling the wind patterns for an entire world on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>Implacable but not malevolent, an anemos guides its winds along the paths dictated by nature, heedless of how the weather patterns help or harm the creatures in their paths, whether through drought, flood, tornadoes, or hurricanes. Mighty heroes sometimes trap an anemos in earth and force it to protect the heroes’ allies or destroy their enemies in exchange for its freedom. While an anemos always honors such agreements, such heroes may find the weather turning against them at a crucial moment many years later.</p>
<p>Anemoi generally have little to do with their own kind, though they may hold court with a plethora of lesser air creatures. Councils of anemoi occur perhaps once every millennium, when the four anemoi who oversee a particular world assemble to confer and debate. Their personalities take on aspects of the winds they guide, and such councils often end in duels of winds, though such duels are always nonlethal due to the anemoi’s regeneration.</p>
<p>Anemoi are particularly fond of music, particularly that of wind instruments, and each can perform as a full wind ensemble with its own winds simultaneously. They appreciate musical talent in their followers, allowing sirens and other creatures with musical skills to join their courts. Despite anemoi’s aloofness, skilled mortal musicians can earn their way into the creatures’ good graces, and romance between anemoi and mortals, while extraordinarily rare, is not impossible.</p>
<p>Though they are beings of air, anemoi usually choose to appear in humanoid form. Many sylphs, sorcerers with an air elemental bloodline, and aerokineticists make grandiose claims about anemos descent, but only a handful have the pedigree to support those claims, and they tend to become notable heroes and villains in their own right.</p>

<span id="bestiary5-anemos-elder-anemoi"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Elder Anemoi</a><a class="headerlink" href="#elder-anemoi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>While all anemoi are ancient beings with incredible abilities, elder anemoi are closer in power to true gods. Rather than serving as members of councils that control the winds on a world in the Material Plane, the elder anemoi each control notable regions on the Elemental Plane of Air with powerful wind features, such as the Living Hurricane and the Foreverstorm.</p>
<p>Anemoi typically become elder anemoi only after tending a world’s winds from that world’s infancy to its destruction, which would make elder anemoi older than most mortals can fathom. Elder anemoi possess all the powers of a typical anemos as well as 10 mythic ranks and several powerful abilities unique to each individual elder anemos.</p>

<p>An anemos who is assigned to guide one of a world’s winds gains an additional special ability tied to that wind.</p>
<p><strong>Austral</strong>: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the south winds can whip them into a frenzied dust storm. The storm encompasses a cylinder with a 30-foot radius centered on the anemos, and is 60 feet high. It deals 20d6 points of fire damage to other creatures within the cylinder, blinds them for 1d4 rounds, and knocks them prone. A successful DC 31 Fortitude save halves the damages and negates the other effects.</p>
<p><strong>Boreal</strong>: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the north winds can send forth a blast of ice slivers from its hand in a 30-foot line. This shredding blast deals 20d6 points of cold damage to anything in its path, as well as 2d4 points of Dexterity damage, and a damaged creature moves at half speed for 1d4 rounds as the ice infuses its limbs. A successful DC 31 Reflex save halves the cold damage and negates the other effects.</p>
<p><strong>Eural</strong>: Once per day, an anemos who guides the eastern winds can use them to bring misfortune to any creatures they touch. Creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt a DC 31 Will save to avoid suffering bad luck. If a creature succeeds, its close brush with disaster leaves it shaken for 1d6 rounds. If it fails, for the next 6 rounds, anytime it attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Once per day, an anemos who guides the western winds can soothe the spirits of any creature touched by its gentle breezes. For 1 minute, creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt DC 31 Will saves each time they attempt to attack or take aggressive actions toward another creature. If a creature succeeds, it can attack as normal. If it fails, it can’t attack and is staggered for 1 minute.</p>
