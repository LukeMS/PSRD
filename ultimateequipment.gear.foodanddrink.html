<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 cP; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>This is a loaf of bread with a crust that ranges from crisp to soft, depending on the local ingredients and baking methods. Bread may be leavened or unleavened, depending on whether yeast is used to make it rise. Unleavened bread is also known as flatbread, and ranges in thickness from that of a cracker to half an inch thick. Both leavened and unleavened bread may be stuffed with cheese, fruit, olives, meat, or other rich ingredients when prepared for festive occasions. Bread that is left exposed to air become dry and stale in about a day.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.</p>
<p>This drink is a favorite of goblins, boggards, and other primitive humanoids. It is made by soaking a poisonous toad or frog (or its eggs) in weak beer, or by “milking” these animals for their poison and mixing it with the beer (which allows the animal to be used over and over again). Some tribes use wide-mouthed jugs and leave the dead animal inside as a crunchy treat for eating once the drink is gone. A creature drunk on bufo has the dazzled condition in addition to the normal intoxication effect.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p>These translucent, salty fish eggs are a delicacy. They are usually eaten as a spread on crackers, boiled eggs, bread, pastries, or vegetables. They tend to spoil quickly and are rare outside of the coastal areas where they are harvested. Purists only consider sturgeon eggs to be true caviar, but others are more relaxed about the definition and include salmon, trout, and whitefish eggs as caviar. In some countries, the roe of larger exotic fish and sea creatures (such as chuul, giant gar, and reefclaws) are eaten as caviar, though at much higher prices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cheese">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-cheese"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Cheese</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cheese" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 sp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>The listed price is for a hunk of cheese from a wheel. A 5- or 10-pound wheel of aged cheese is encased in a tough rind, which keeps the interior fresh.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chocolate">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-chocolate"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Chocolate</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chocolate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 5 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>This dark, bitter treat can be consumed as a solid or melted and added to a beverage such as milk. In some lands it is mixed with sugar or chilies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coffee">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-coffee"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Coffee</a><a class="headerlink" href="#coffee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 cP; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>This drink is brewed by pouring boiling water through crushed, roasted coffee beans. Two cups is potent enough to reduce the penalties from the fatigued condition from –2 to –1 for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Brewing your own coffee requires ground coffee beans (5 cp for 1 pound of coffee beans, or 8 cp for 1 pound of ground beans) and a cooking device. You can boil the grounds in a pot, then pour the liquid after allowing the solids to settle, or filter the drink by pouring it through a sieve or cloth. Many travelers prefer the convenience of using a coffee pot (see page 62).</p>

<div class="section" id="dwarven-stout">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-dwarven-stout"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Dwarven Stout</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dwarven-stout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 cP; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>More a family of beers than one single drink, dwarven stout is known by different names in human lands. Dwarven stouts are dark beers characterized by a slightly burnt flavor and a foamy head; they are said to be as filling as a meal. Most dwarven clans use a recipe unique to that clan, and family rivalries over the best brew may date back for hundreds of years.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1-1/2 lbs.</p>
<p>Dwarven trail rations consist of smoked sausages and salted meat, rounded out with hard biscuits and dried vegetables. If you are a dwarf who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you can hustle or make a forced march for an additional hour without ill effects, but cannot do both in the same day. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day’s worth.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p>Elves favor soft trail bread made of oats mixed with other grains, berries, and nuts and sweetened with honey. They supplement this trail bread with dried fruits and nuts. If you are an elf who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you receive a +2 bonus on checks and saves that benefit from the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-endurance"><span class="std std-ref">Endurance</span></a> feat.

<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p>Almost any preserved food can be found in gnome trail rations, which are designed to keep a wandering gnome from needing to dine on the same meal twice in a week. If you are a gnome who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you are treated as being 1 Hit Die higher for the purposes of spells and supernatural abilities that have variable effects based on Hit Dice, such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.colorspray.html#corerulebook-spells-colorspray-color-spray"><span class="std std-ref">color spray</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.sleep.html#corerulebook-spells-sleep-sleep"><span class="std std-ref">sleep</span></a>. This does not actually improve your caster level, character level, or Hit Dice in any other way. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day’s worth.</p>

<div class="section" id="grog">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-grog"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Grog</a><a class="headerlink" href="#grog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 cP; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>A foul mix of different alcohols and whatever’s handy, grog was invented by pirates and sailors and never managed to crawl far onto land. Grog is no one’s first choice of drink, but anyone who’s spent enough time on a ship has had at least a taste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="haggis">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-haggis"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Haggis</a><a class="headerlink" href="#haggis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 sp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1-1/2 lbs.</p>
<p>This dish is a meaty pudding made of sheep organs (mainly heart, liver, and lungs) minced with onion, oats, fat, spices, and salt, wrapped in a sheep stomach and slow-cooked. Though its ingredients discourage cautious eaters, fans of haggis consider it a hearty meal with a wonderful texture. It is usually served with turnips, potatoes, and whiskey.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="halfling-trail-rations">
<span id="ultimateequipment-gear-foodanddrink-halfling-trail-rations"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Halfling Trail Rations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#halfling-trail-rations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 sp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>A day’s worth of halfling trail rations is actually more than what a typical adventuring halfling eats in a day—a full belly strengthens a halfling’s resolve. Common foods include sweetened dried fruit, aged sausage, hard sharp cheese, honey cakes, and a mixture of roasted grains, nuts, and molasses. If you are a halfling who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you reduce the penalty for the shaken condition from –2 to –1. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day’s worth.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>This golden liquid is used as a sweetener. It naturally resists spoilage, and if stored in a sealed wooden, glass, or ceramic container it can be used to preserve fruit, nuts, meat, or even leather for decades.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ice-cream">

<p>This exotic dessert is made with milk and cream, often flavored with fruit or mint. Because it quickly melts at room temperature, it must be made fresh from snow or ice, or maintained at a low temperature, such as in a cold cellar or with alchemy or magic. This limitation means it is expensive and in most lands it is only available during certain seasons. The listed price is for a large scoop (1 cup).</p>
