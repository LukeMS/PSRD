<span id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-inquisitor"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Inquisitor</a><a class="headerlink" href="#inquisitor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Almost everyone has a vision of the inquisitor—garbed in a mix of regalia and the rough-and-tumble tools of the adventurer, her word is often treated as divine law. But this is merely the most dramatic aspect of the inquisitor. Her world is filled with secret knowledge, constant danger, and strange mortal and outsider politics. The inquisitor’s path has many branches and specializations, each with its own methods for rooting out and vanquishing enemies of the faith.</p>
<p>An inquisitor has a class ability that gives her access to one of her deity’s domains; this access is one way to tune an inquisitor’s abilities to fit the deity’s interests. However, because an inquisitor only gets the granted powers of a domain and not its spells, some domains are poor choices for an inquisitor because they rely on cleric class abilities that inquisitors don’t get. For example, the Sun domain’s 1st-level granted power augments the effects of channel energy, but inquisitors don’t have the channel energy ability, so they gain no benefit from their domain selection until 8th level, when they get a second granted power.</p>
<p>To remedy that problem, this section introduces inquisitions—new, specialized domainlike class features for inquisitors that grant abilities appropriate to their deity’s portfolio. Following the inquisitions are new inquisitor archetypes.</p>
<div class="section" id="inquisitions">
<span id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-inquisitions"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Inquisitions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#inquisitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While inquisitors often take on the domains permitted to the clerics of the faith, they are privy to special lore not open to priests and other agents of their religion. These divine pursuits, called inquisitions, grant inquisitors the tools necessary for the fight against enemies of the faith. An inquisitor may select an inquisition in place of a domain.</p>
<p>If an inquisition’s granted power calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character’s inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier. Unless otherwise stated, the caster level for granted power spell-like abilities is equal to the inquisitor’s class level.</p>
<p>Inquisitions are intended for inquisitors, not for other classes that give access to domains. While a cleric or other domain-using class can select an inquisition in place of a domain (if appropriate to the character’s deity), inquisitions do not grant domain spell slots or domain spells, and therefore are much weaker choices for those classes. These other classes use the appropriate class level as their inquisitor level for the purpose of inquisition granted powers (clerics use their cleric level as their inquisitor level, and so on).</p>

A mishap or an accident appropriate to the environment occurs, such as a branch falling on the creature, rocks falling from the ceiling, or some other nonmagical misfortune; regardless of the cause, the mishap deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every two inquisitor levels you possess (Reflex half). The GM decides whether this damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-verdict-of-exorcism"><strong>Verdict of Exorcism (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, an inquisitor using judgment can unleash the verdict of exorcism on a creature. When she does, her judgment ends, but the creature is dazed for 1 round (Will negates); if the creature is possessed, the possessing entity must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 inquisitor level + inquisitor’s Wisdom bonus), or be exorcised and never again allowed in that same body.

<p>While all inquisitors hunt the enemies of the faith, sometimes, either through political maneuvering by her enemies or an unyielding tenacity that breaks her faith’s basic tenets, an inquisitor can find herself a heretic. Still unyielding in her cause, these heretics are accustomed to using guile and deception to hide themselves and their activities while they continue to hunt their enemies.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-judgment"><strong>Judgment (Su)</strong>: A heretic gains the following judgment in addition to the normal list of inquisitor judgments.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-escape"><em>Escape (Su)</em>: Each time the inquisitor using this judgment hits an opponent with a melee or ranged attack, she can use a move action attempt to create a diversion to hide (see the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.stealth.html#corerulebook-skills-stealth-stealth"><span class="std std-ref">Stealth</span></a> skill).</p>

<p>An inquisitor who becomes an ex-inquisitor can, with the GM’s permission, take the heretic archetype, replacing her class abilities with the appropriate archetype abilities.

<p>This inquisitor uses guile and deception to blend in among the enemies of the faith rather than confronting them head-on.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-misdirection"><strong>Misdirection (Sp)</strong>: At 1st level, each day when the infiltrator prepares spells, she may choose an alignment. She detects as that alignment as if she had used <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.misdirection.html#corerulebook-spells-misdirection-misdirection"><span class="std std-ref">misdirection</span></a> on a creature with that alignment (this does not change any divination results about her other than her alignment).

<p>Some inquisitors wander the land to spread the true word of their faith. Often they come into conflict with those hostile to their teachings or to the preacher’s need to help those who cannot help themselves. The leaders of evil or aggressive religions send these preachers into new territories to win converts and hopefully allies. Often, they start uprisings against powers hostile to their religion, or defend a group of honest believers from the depredations of the unfaithful.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-determination"><strong>Determination (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the preacher is a person of few words on the battlefield, but those words hold great power and authority. Once per day, the inquisitor can use this ability to create one of the following effects. Each is a free action to use.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-aggression"><em>Aggression</em>: The preacher may reroll an attack roll that she just made before the results of the roll are revealed. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-defense"><em>Defense</em>: When the inquisitor would be hit by a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action she may add a +4 insight bonus to her Armor Class against that attack, and if this makes the inquisitor’s AC higher than the opponent’s attack roll, the attack misses.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-warning"><em>Warning</em>: When a preacher’s ally within line of sight would be hit by a melee or ranged attack, she may call out a warning to that ally, and the attacker must reroll the attack and use the results of the second roll. The ally must be able to hear the preacher and must not be helpless for this ability to have any effect.</p>
<p>Whenever the preacher could select a bonus teamwork feat (at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level), she can instead choose to increase her number of uses per day of this ability by one. This ability replaces solo tactics.</p>

<div class="section" id="sin-eater-archetype">

<p>There is a sect of inquisitors in some religions that believes it is not enough to hunt the enemies of the church—one must also devour those enemies’ sins. More benign versions of the practice believe that sin, or evil, is taken out of the world when a sin is devoured, denying the enemy’s soul to the enemy’s god and purifying the world of its taint. Followers of malevolent churches believe that consuming the sins of good folk not only corrupts the enemy soul to keep it from the celestial planes, but also taints the souls of those who witness the sin-eating or the corpse of its victim. Consuming sins empowers the sin eater, at least for a time.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-eat-sin"><strong>Eat Sin (Sp)</strong>: At 1st level, as a free action, when the sin eater inquisitor kills an enemy, she may eat the sins of that enemy by spending 1 minute adjacent to its corpse. This provokes attacks of opportunity. The inquisitor can rush this ritual, performing it as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, but she only gains half the normal benefit (see below).</p>
<p>Eating the enemy’s sins heals the inquisitor of a number of hit points of damage equal to 1d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +5). The enemy must have been killed by the sin eater within the last hour, and it must have had at least as many Hit Dice as half the inquisitor’s level. The inquisitor can use this ability once for each enemy she kills. This ability has no effect on mindless creatures or those with Intelligence 2 or less.</p>
<p>At 5th level, the healing increases to 2d8 plus her inquisitor level (maximum +10); it increases to 3d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +15) at 9th level and to 4d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +20) at 13th level.</p>
<p>In some faiths, this “eating” is a purely symbolic act, while in others, the inquisitor must eat a small amount of food and water as part of the ritual. A few extreme faiths actually require the inquisitor to eat some of the body of the slain enemy.</p>
<p>At 8th level, when a sin eater eats the sins of a creature that would rise as an undead (such as someone slain by a shadow, spectre, or vampire), the sin eater may choose to accept 1 temporary negative level to absorb the taint in the corpse, preventing it from rising as an undead. This negative level can be removed with the appropriate magic, though it automatically expires after 24 hours, and never becomes a permanent negative level. At the GM’s discretion, this ability may prevent a ghost from using its rejuvenation ability.</p>
<p>This ability replaces an inquisitor’s domain.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-speak-with-dead"><strong>Speak with Dead (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, when the inquisitor eats an enemy’s sins, within 10 minutes of doing so, she can ask the remnants of the enemy’s soul questions as if using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.speakwithdead.html#corerulebook-spells-speakwithdead-speak-with-dead"><span class="std std-ref">speak with dead</span></a>, with a caster level equal to her inquisitor level. She does not need the enemy’s corpse to use this ability (she can eat sin, move away from the corpse, then use <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.speakwithdead.html#corerulebook-spells-speakwithdead-speak-with-dead"><span class="std std-ref">speak with dead</span></a>), though the soul gets a saving throw just as a corpse would. This ability replaces the bonus teamwork feat gained at 6th level.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-inquisitor-burden-of-sin"><strong>Burden of Sin (Sp)</strong>: At 14th level, a sin eater may spend a full-round action to transfer one harmful affliction, condition, or spell effect from another creature to herself (this includes curses, possessions, and permanent effects such as petrification, or any condition that <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.breakenchantment.html#corerulebook-spells-breakenchantment-break-enchantment"><span class="std std-ref">break enchantment</span></a> can end or reverse). The effect to be transferred is chosen by the sin eater and affects her as if she were the original target, continuing its duration (if any) and preventing any further effect on the original bearer. For example, the inquisitor could transfer a lethal disease to herself, or petrify herself to restore a petrified comrade. The sin eater can use this ability as often as desired, even using it multiple times on the same creature. This ability replaces exploit weakness.</p>
