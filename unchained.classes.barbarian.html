<p>For some heroes, the rage that lives within them can’t be contained. Whether this fury is a product of heritage or of nature, these adventurers have learned to harness it, turning its power against their foes. The primal warriors known as barbarians transform their rage into a potent weapon on a battlefield. Heedless of their wounds and possessed of unstoppable bloodlust, these savage brutes are the embodiment of war.</p>
<p><strong>Unchained</strong>: The unchained barbarian is similar in many regards to its counterpart in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>—she still goes into a rage and gains rage powers, but many of the details have been changed. Rage now grants temporary hit points and static bonuses on attack and damage rolls, rather than bonuses to ability scores that force players to recalculate a number of statistics. Additionally, many rage powers now function whenever the barbarian is raging, as opposed to just once per rage. Finally, the overall utility of many of the rage powers has been adjusted to make them more useful and interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any nonlawful.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d12.</p>

<span id="unchained-classes-barbarian-class-features"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Class Features</a><a class="headerlink" href="#class-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-fast-movement"><strong>Fast Movement (Ex)</strong>: A barbarian’s base speed is faster than the norm for her race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian’s base speed.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-rage"><strong>Rage (Ex)</strong>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. At 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. For each level after 1st she possesses, the barbarian can rage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as that gained from <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.bearsendurance.html#bear's endurance"><span class="std std-ref">bear’s endurance</span></a>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter a rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
<p>While in a rage, a barbarian gains a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. She also gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. These temporary hit points are lost first when a character takes damage, disappear when the rage ends, and are not replenished if the barbarian enters a rage again within 1 minute of her previous rage. While in a rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.acrobatics.html#corerulebook-skills-acrobatics-acrobatics"><span class="std std-ref">Acrobatics</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.fly.html#corerulebook-skills-fly-fly"><span class="std std-ref">Fly</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.ride.html#corerulebook-skills-ride-ride"><span class="std std-ref">Ride</span></a>) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting).</p>
<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action, and is fatigued for 1 minute after a rage ends. A barbarian can’t enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a rage multiple times per day. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-rage-powers"><strong>Rage Powers (Ex)</strong>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
<p>Some of the following rage powers are stances. Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the rage ends.</p>
<p><em>Accurate Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can focus her strikes. She gains a +1 competence bonus on melee attack rolls and thrown weapon attack rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Animal Fury (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (if the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 if the barbarian is Small) plus the barbarian’s Strength modifier. If made as part of a full-attack action with manufactured weapons, the bite attack is made at the barbarian’s full base attack bonus – 5, and she adds only 1/2 her Strength modifier to the damage roll. The barbarian can make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. If the bite attack hits, grapple checks attempted by the barbarian against the target until the end of the round gain a +2 bonus.</p>
<p><em>Auspicious Mark (Su)</em>: The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. As a swift action, she can call upon the spirits’ favor toincrease any d20 roll she just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels she has. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll. This ability can be used only once per day.</p>
<p><em>Bleeding Blow (Ex)</em>: While in the powerful stance, the barbarian can make an attack that causes her enemies to bleed profusely. Once per round, she can have one of her attacks deal an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/2 her bonus damage from powerful stance. This bleed damage bypasses damage reduction. This bleed damage doesn’t stack with itself. A barbarian must have the powerful stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Calm Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can enter a state of calm. While in this stance, the barbarian doesn’t gain any benefits from rage other than the temporary hit points, but she doesn’t take any of the penalties from rage (including the penalty to AC and the restriction on actions she can take). Rounds spent in a calm stance still count against her total number of rounds of rage per day. This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Clear Mind (Ex)</em>: When the barbarian fails a Will saving throw, she can attempt another Will saving throw at the end of her next turn (using the original DC). If the second saving throw is successful, the barbarian is treated as if she succeeded at the first saving throw, negating or reducing the effect as determined by the spell or effect. If this second saving throw fails, the barbarian suffers the full effects of the spell or effect as normal. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Crippling Blow (Ex)</em>: Once per day when the barbarian hits with an attack, she can deal 1 point of ability damage to the target’s Strength or Dexterity score. This damage increases by 1 point for every 4 levels the barbarian has. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Deadly Accuracy (Ex)</em>: If the barbarian scores a critical threat while in the accurate stance, she applies double the accurate stance’s bonus when rolling to confirm the critical. A barbarian must have the accurate stance rage power and be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Eater of Magic (Su)</em>: When the barbarian succeeds at a saving throw to resist a spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability, she gains temporary hit points equal to the spell’s level (in the case of spells or spell-like abilities) or 1/2 the CR of the effect’s creator (in the case of supernatural abilities). These temporary hit points disappear when the barbarian’s rage ends, and they stack with her temporary hit points from rage but not with other temporary hit points gained from this rage power. A barbarian must have the superstition rage power and be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Elemental Stance (Su)</em>: When the barbarian adopts this stance, she chooses an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Her melee attacks deal 1 additional point of damage of the chosen type. This damage increases to 1d6 points at 8th level. At 12th level, the barbarian’s critical hits deal an additional 1d10 points of energy damage of the same type (2d10 if the weapon deals ×3 damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals ×4 damage on a critical hit). This is a stance rage power. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Energy Absorption (Su)</em>: Once per day, the barbarian can absorb the energy from a single attack that deals damage of the energy type she resists with the energy resistance rage power. She takes no damage from the attack and doesn’t attempt a saving throw. Instead, she increases the temporary hit points from her rage by an amount equal to 1/2 the damage she would have taken (ignoring her energy resistance). If the barbarian is at least 16th level, once before her rage ends, she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. The breath weapon deals an amount of damage equal to the full amount the barbarian would have taken from the absorbed effect. Creatures affected by the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + her Constitution modifier). She retains the temporary hit points from this ability even if she unleashes this breath weapon. A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power and be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Energy Resistance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). At 8th level, she gains limited immunity to the same type of energy, as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.protectionfromenergy.html#corerulebook-spells-protectionfromenergy-protection-from-energy"><span class="std std-ref">protection from energy</span></a>. She can absorb 2 points of damage per level, and she applies her energy resistance first. The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected, and it can’t be changed. This rage power can be selected more than once; each time, it applies to a different energy type.</p>
<p><em>Fearless Rage (Ex)</em>: The barbarian is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions (but not the panicked condition). A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Flesh Wound (Ex)</em>: Once per day, the barbarian can avoid serious harm from an attack. She attempts a Fortitude save with a DC equal to the damage that would be dealt by the attack. If she succeeds, she takes no damage from the attack. If she fails, she takes half damage from the attack and the damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this ability after the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Ground Breaker (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can attack the floor around her as a full-round action. This attack automatically hits and deals damage normally. If the barbarian deals more damage than the floor’s hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except the barbarian, must succeed at DC 15 Reflex saves or be knocked prone. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Ground Breaker, Greater (Ex)</em>: When using the ground breaker rage power, the barbarian can extend the radius of the effect by 5 feet. This rage power can be selected up to three times, and its effects stack. A barbarian must be at least 8th level and have the ground breaker rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Guarded Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can take on a more defensive posture. This grants her a +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class for the duration of her current rage. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Increased Damage Reduction (Ex)</em>: The barbarian’s damage reduction increases by 2/— whenever she is raging. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its effects stack. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Inspire Ferocity (Ex)</em>: While in the reckless stance, the barbarian imparts the stance’s bonus and penalty to all willing allies within 30 feet of her. A barbarian must have the reckless stance rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Internal Fortitude</em> <em>(Ex)</em>: The barbarian is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Intimidating Glare (Ex)</em>: The barbarian adds her Strength modifier in place of her Charisma modifier on all <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> checks to demoralize a foe. She can attempt an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> check to demoralize an adjacent foe as a move action instead of a standard action. If the barbarian successfully demoralizes an adjacent foe, that foe is shaken for the remainder of the barbarian’s current rage.</p>
<p><em>Knockback (Ex)</em>: Once per round, the barbarian can attempt a bull rush against one target in place of a melee attack, using her full CMB regardless of the attack it replaces. If the bull rush is successful, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the barbarian’s Strength modifier and is knocked back as normal. The barbarian doesn’t move with the target. This bull rush doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Knockdown Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can focus on toppling her foes. Once per round, she can make a trip attack against one target in place of a melee attack. If she succeeds, the target is knocked prone. This trip attempt doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Lethal Accuracy (Ex)</em>: While in the accurate stance, the barbarian’s critical multiplier for damage increases by 1 (a ×2 multiplier becomes ×3, a ×3 multiplier becomes ×4, and a ×4 multiplier becomes ×5). A barbarian must have the accurate stance and deadly accuracy rage powers and be at least 16th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Low-Light Vision (Ex)</em>: The barbarian’s senses sharpen, and she gains low-light vision.</p>
<p><em>Mighty Swing (Ex)</em>: The barbarian automatically confirms a critical hit. This power is used as an immediate action once a critical threat has been determined. This ability can be used only once per day. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Night Vision (Ex)</em>: The barbarian’s senses grow incredibly sharp, and she gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of that darkvision increases by 60 feet. A barbarian must have a darkvision racial trait, low-light vision racial trait, or the low-light vision rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>No Escape (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can move up to double her base speed as an immediate action. She can use this ability only when an adjacent foe uses a withdraw action to move away from her. She must end her movement adjacent to the enemy that used the withdraw action. The barbarian provokes attacks of opportunity as normal during this movement.</p>
<p><em>Perfect Clarity (Ex)</em>: While in the calm stance, the barbarian can roll twice for any miss chances or Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions, taking the better result. A barbarian must have the calm stance rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Powerful Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can focus her ferocity. She gains a +1 bonus on melee damage rolls and thrown weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Protect Vitals (Ex)</em>: While in the guarded stance, the barbarian gains an additional +4 dodge bonus to AC against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.  A barbarian must have the guarded stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Quick Reflexes (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can make one additional attack of opportunity per round.</p>
<p><em>Raging Climber (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains a climb speed equal to 1/2 her base land speed, taking into account her fast movement class feature. She can’t use this climb speed to climb any surface with a DC higher than 20. She also gains a +8 enhancement bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.climb.html#corerulebook-skills-climb-climb"><span class="std std-ref">Climb</span></a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Raging Leaper (Ex)</em>: The barbarian is always considered to have a running start when attempting an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.acrobatics.html#corerulebook-skills-acrobatics-acrobatics"><span class="std std-ref">Acrobatics</span></a> check to jump. In addition, she gains a +8 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.acrobatics.html#corerulebook-skills-acrobatics-acrobatics"><span class="std std-ref">Acrobatics</span></a> checks to jump. Finally, if the barbarian falls, she halves the total distance fallen for the purposes of determining damage taken from the fall.</p>
<p><em>Raging Swimmer (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains a swim speed equal to 1/2 her base land speed (taking into account her fast movement class feature). She also gains a +8 enhancement bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.swim.html#corerulebook-skills-swim-swim"><span class="std std-ref">Swim</span></a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Reckless Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can attack with abandon at the expense of her defense. She gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, but takes a –1 penalty to AC. This bonus and penalty increase by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Reflexive Dodge (Ex)</em>: While in the guarded stance, the barbarian can apply her dodge bonus to AC as a bonus on Reflex saving throws. A barbarian must have the guarded stance rage power and be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Regenerative Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can continually replenish her health. At the start of her turn, she regains 1 temporary hit point for every 4 levels she has (up to 5 hit points per round), but this cannot give her more than her maximum temporary hit points from rage. This is a stance rage power. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Renewed Vigor (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8 points of damage + her Constitution modifier. For every 4 levels the barbarian has beyond 4th, the amount healed increases by 1d8 (to a maximum of 5d8 at 20th level). This ability can be used only once per day. The barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Renewed Vitality (Ex)</em>: The barbarian ignores the effect of 1 point of ability penalty or ability damage per 2 levels she has (maximum 10). At 6th level, the barbarian can also ignore 1 negative level per 4 levels she has. She takes the full effects of the ability penalties, ability damage, or negative levels once her rage ends.</p>
<p><em>Roused Anger (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can enter a rage even when fatigued. If the barbarian enters a rage while fatigued, she loses the fatigued condition and she does not gain temporary hit points from rage. Once this rage ends, the barbarian is exhausted for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><em>Scent (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains the scent ability. She can use this ability to locate unseen foes. See page 564 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> for more information.</p>
<p><em>Sharpened Accuracy (Ex)</em>: While in the accurate stance, the barbarian ignores the miss chance for concealment and treats total concealment as concealment. She also ignores cover penalties except those from total cover. A barbarian must have the accurate stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Shove Aside (Ex)</em>: Whenever the barbarian charges, she may push past one of her allies. That ally does not block the path of the charge as long as the ally is not adjacent to the target of the charge. This does not move the ally’s position; it simply allows the barbarian to move past.</p>
<p><em>Shove Aside, Greater (Ex)</em>: This functions as shove aside, but it applies to any number of allies, so long as they are not adjacent to the target of the charge. A barbarian must have the shove aside rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Smasher (Ex)</em>: Whenever the barbarian attempts a sunder combat maneuver or makes an attack against an unattended object, she ignores 1 point of the object’s hardness per barbarian level she has.</p>
<p><em>Sprint (Ex)</em>: The barbarian adds 1/2 her speed to the distance she can move when she runs or charges. A barbarian must have the swift foot rage power and be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Strength Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can summon mighty strength. She gains a +1 competence bonus on combat maneuvers and to her CMD. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. In addition, she gains a +8 competence bonus on Strength checks to lift, push, bend, or break objects (this does not apply to combat maneuvers). This is a stance rage power.</p>
<p><em>Superstition (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws made to resist spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. The barbarian cannot be the willing target of any spell and must attempt saving throws to resist all spells, even those cast by allies.</p>
<p><em>Swift Foot (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains a 10-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three times; its effects stack.</p>
<p><em>Taunting Stance (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can leave herself open to attacks while preparing devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the barbarian while she’s in this stance, but every attack against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is resolved prior to each provoking attack. This is a stance rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Terrifying Howl (Ex)</em>: The barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl as a standard action. All enemies that have been shaken by the barbarian (usually through the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> skill) within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + her Strength modifier) or be panicked for 1d4+1 rounds. Once an enemy has attempted a save versus this ability (whether successful or not), it’s immune to this power for 24 hours. A barbarian must be at least 8th level and have the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Unexpected Strike (Ex)</em>: The barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the barbarian, regardless of whether that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. The barbarian can use this ability only when there are no other foes in a square threatened by the barbarian. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Witch Hunter (Ex)</em>: The barbarian gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls against creatures possessing spells or spell-like abilities. This damage bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. In addition, if she confirms a critical hit against a creature affected by an ongoing beneficial spell effect, that effect is suppressed for 1 round (determined randomly if the creature is currently affected by more than one effect). A barbarian must have the superstition rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-uncanny-dodge"><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-danger-sense"><strong>Danger Sense (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (if the barbarian has trap sense from another class).</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-improved-uncanny-dodge"><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least 4 more levels in a class that provides sneak attack than the barbarian has barbarian levels.</p>
<p>If the barbarian also has uncanny dodge from another class, levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the barbarian.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-damage-reduction"><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Each time the barbarian takes damage from a weapon or natural attack, subtract 1 from the damage taken. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction rises by 1 point (up to 5 points at 19th level). Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-greater-rage"><strong>Greater Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, a barbarian’s bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +3. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 3 per Hit Die.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-indomitable-will"><strong>Indomitable Will (Ex)</strong>: At 14th level, the barbarian gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while raging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she gains during her rage.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-tireless-rage"><strong>Tireless Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, a barbarian is no longer fatigued at the end of her rage. If she enters a rage again within 1 minute of ending a rage, she doesn’t gain any temporary hit points from her rage.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-barbarian-mighty-rage"><strong>Mighty Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 4 per Hit Die.</p>
