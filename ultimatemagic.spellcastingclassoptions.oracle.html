<p>Not all vessels of the divine choose their path. Rather, some find themselves chosen, raised to a life of power and responsibility by forces they themselves may not understand. These are the oracles, agents gifted by providence and serving not a single deity, but rather many sources, venerating and drawing magic from all those patron deities who support their ideals. Whether a curse or a gift, the strange powers and unsettling mysteries of the oracles make them forces to be reckoned with, both in the halls of power and on the fields of battle.</p>
<p>This section introduces new oracle mysteries. Following these mysteries are six new oracle archetypes. Each archetype includes a list of recommended mysteries that are particularly suitable for that archetype, though the archetypes are not limited only to oracles of those mysteries. An archetype’s bonus spells replace the normal bonus spells for the oracle’s chosen mystery.</p>

<p>The following are new mysteries for oracles. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these revelations is equal to 10 + 1/2 the oracle’s class level + the oracle’s Charisma modifier. Effects that duplicate spells use the oracle’s class level as her caster level.</p>

You are considered proficient with this weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp. At 3rd level, the blade is made of cold iron. At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the blade gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 11th level, the blade is made of adamantine. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-riddle-of-steel"><em>Riddle of Steel (Su)</em>: Your sacred bond with metal gives you insight into its form and function.

You can then strike outward with it as if it were a weapon making a melee attack. For the purpose of this ability, you are proficient with this weapon. You can use the weapon to perform combat maneuvers. Make a melee attack roll against a creature within 30 feet; you may use <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#weapon finesse (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Weapon Finesse</span></a> with this attack. If you hit, the weapon deals 1d8 points of slashing damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. After this attack, the clothing returns to its normal length and hardness.

You can scry for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level; these rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of iron and steel.

<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the time mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-aging-touch"><em>Aging Touch (Su)</em>: Your touch ages living creatures and objects. As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1 point of Strength damage for every two oracle levels you possess to living creatures. Against objects or constructs, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per oracle level. If used against an object in another creature’s possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every five oracle levels you possess.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-erase-from-time"><em>Erase from Time (Su)</em>: As a melee touch attack, you can temporarily remove a creature from time altogether. The target creature must make a Fortitude save or vanish completely for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1 round). No magic or divinations can detect the creature during this time, as it exists outside of time and space—in effect, the creature ceases to exist for the duration of this ability. At the end of the duration, the creature reappears unharmed in the space it last occupied (or the nearest possible space, if the original space is now occupied). You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-knowledge-of-the-ages"><em>Knowledge of the Ages (Su)</em>: You can search through time to recall some bit of forgotten lore or information.

<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-momentary-glimpse"><em>Momentary Glimpse (Su)</em>: Once per day, you can gain a glimpse into your immediate future.

At 5th level, and every four levels thereafter, you can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-rewind-time"><em>Rewind Time (Su)</em>: Once per day as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed.

<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-temporal-celerity"><em>Temporal Celerity (Su)</em>: Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll twice and take either result. At 7th level, you can always act in the surprise round, but if you fail to notice the ambush, you act last, regardless of your initiative result (you act in the normal order in following rounds). At 11th level, you can roll for initiative three times and take any one of the results.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-time-flicker"><em>Time Flicker (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining concealment (as the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.blur.html#corerulebook-spells-blur-blur"><span class="std std-ref">blur</span></a> spell). You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.blink.html#corerulebook-spells-blink-blink"><span class="std std-ref">blink</span></a> spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal time flicker duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-time-hop"><em>Time Hop (Su)</em>: As a move action, you can teleport up to 10 feet per oracle level that you possess per day. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must have line of sight to your destination to use this ability. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each creature brought. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p id="ultimatemagic-spellcastingclassoptions-oracle-time-sight"><em>Time Sight (Su)</em>: You can peer through the mists of time to see things as they truly are, as if using the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.trueseeing.html#corerulebook-spells-trueseeing-true-seeing"><span class="std std-ref">true seeing</span></a> spell. At 15th level, this functions like <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.momentofprescience.html#corerulebook-spells-momentofprescience-moment-of-prescience"><span class="std std-ref">moment of prescience</span></a>. At 18th level, this functions like <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.foresight.html#corerulebook-spells-foresight-foresight"><span class="std std-ref">foresight</span></a>. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level, but these minutes do not need to be consecutive. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a true master of time and stop aging. You cannot be magically aged and no longer take penalties to your ability scores for aging. Age bonuses still accrue, and any aging penalties that you have already accrued remain in place. You cannot die of old age, but you can be killed or die through accident, disease, poison, or other external effects. In addition, you can cast <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.timestop.html#corerulebook-spells-timestop-time-stop"><span class="std std-ref">time stop</span></a> once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>

This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Your type changes to “outsider (extraplanar),” except on your associated plane, where your type is “outsider (native).” In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic.
