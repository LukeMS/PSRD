<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> psychic 9</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> no; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a perfect record of your physical body in the Akashic Record at the time the spell is cast. This record includes your current hit point total, physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and any conditional modifiers or conditions such as ability damage to physical ability scores, disease, negative levels, and poison. If at any point within the duration of the spell you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or are slain by a death effect that is not mind-affecting, you can immediately let your current physical body die and assume the record of your physical body on your next turn. When this happens, your corpse disappears, and you can either resume the place of your dead body (already wearing any clothing still attached to the corpse) or appear in any place you’ve been within 500 feet of where your corpse lies (but without any of your gear).</p>
<p>You still retain your original mind, and therefore don’t regain any spells. You are still under any mental influences and energy drain effects you were under when you recalled the record of your physical body, but don’t retain any physical effects such as bleed damage or poison (unless you suffered from these conditions at the time the spell was cast). Spells affecting you when you store a record of yourself abide by their normal durations. For example, if you were affected by <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.catsgrace.html#cat's grace"><span class="std std-ref">cat’s grace</span></a> when you created the record and you restore your body 1 hour later, you won’t be under that effect anymore since its duration has already expired. This spell doesn’t allow you to avoid dying of old age. Casting this spell again replaces any previous version you cast; you can’t store more than one copy of yourself in the Akashic Record.</p>
