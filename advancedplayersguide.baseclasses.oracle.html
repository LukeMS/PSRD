<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-role"><strong>Role</strong>: Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>

<p>The following are the class features of the oracle.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-weapon-and-armor-proficiency"><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-spells"><strong>Spells</strong>: An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spelllists.html#corerulebook-spelllists-cleric-spells"><span class="std std-ref">cleric spell lists</span></a>. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the oracle’s Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 of the <em>PRD Core Rulebook</em>).</p>
<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle’s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2–6 are fixed.</p>
<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with âcureâ in the name, inflict spells include all spells with âinflictâ in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-mystery"><strong>Mystery</strong>: Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2–6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-oracles-curse"><strong>Oracle’s Curse (Ex)</strong>: Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle’s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle’s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must choose one of the following curses.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-clouded-vision"><em>Clouded Vision</em>: Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for you to see. You cannot see anything beyond 30 feet, but you can see as if you had darkvision. At 5th level, this distance increases to 60 feet. At 10th level, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. At 15th level, you gain blindsight out to a range of 15 feet.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-deaf"><em>Deaf</em>: You cannot hear and suffer all of the usual penalties for being deafened. You cast all of your spells as if they were modified by the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#silent spell (metamagic)"><span class="std std-ref">Silent Spell</span></a> feat. This does not increase their level or casting time. At 5th level, you receive a +3 competence bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> checks that do not rely upon hearing, and the initiative penalty for being deaf is reduced to –2. At 10th level, you gain scent and you do not suffer any penalty on initiative checks due to being deaf. At 15th level, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-haunted"><em>Haunted</em>: Malevolent spirits follow you wherever you go, causing minor mishaps and strange occurrences (such as unexpected breezes, small objects moving on their own, and faint noises). Retrieving any stored item from your gear requires a standard action, unless it would normally take longer. Any item you drop lands 10 feet away from you in a random direction.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-channel"><em>Channel (Su)</em>: You can channel positive energy like a cleric, using your oracle level as your effective cleric level when determining the amount of damage healed (or caused to undead) and the DC.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-delay-affliction"><em>Delay Affliction (Su)</em>: Once per day as an immediate action, whenever you fail a saving throw against a disease or poison, you may ignore its effects for 1 hour per level.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-energy-body"><em>Energy Body (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can transform your body into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental. In this form, you gain the elemental subtype and give off a warm, welcoming light that increases the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. Any undead creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this damage in place of the normal damage for the attack.

You may provide first aid to two people or treat two people for poison as a standard action (make a separate <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.heal.html#corerulebook-skills-heal-heal"><span class="std std-ref">Heal</span></a> check for each creature). When using the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.heal.html#corerulebook-skills-heal-heal"><span class="std std-ref">Heal</span></a> skill to treat wounds from caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat poison, treat disease, or treat long-term care, you may treat double the normal number of people you may treat at the same time. You may provide long-term care for yourself.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-life-link"><em>Life Link (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and another creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action).</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-lifesense"><em>Lifesense (Su)</em>: You notice and locate living creatures within 30 feet, just as if you possessed the blindsight ability. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-safe-curing"><em>Safe Curing (Su)</em>: Whenever you cast a spell that cures the target of hit point damage, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for spellcasting.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-spirit-boost"><em>Spirit Boost (Su)</em>: Whenever your healing spells heal a target up to its maximum hit points, any excess points persist for 1 round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to your oracle level).</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a perfect channel for life energy. You become immune to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce you below 1 in any ability score. You automatically make saving throws against massive damage. When you are below 0 hit points, you do not die until your negative total is in excess of twice your Constitution score.</p>

<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-automatic-writing"><em>Automatic Writing (Su)</em>: Once per day, you can spend a full hour in uninterrupted meditation.

<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-brain-drain"><em>Brain Drain (Su)</em>: You can take a standard action to violently probe the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The target receives a Will save to negate the effect and immediately knows the source of this harmful mental prying.

<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the nature mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-bonded-mount">Bonded <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.mount.html#corerulebook-spells-mount-mount"><span class="std std-ref">Mount</span></a> (Su): You gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal mount. The creature must be one that you are capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium oracle can select a camel or a horse. A Small oracle can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 4th level. This mount functions as a druid’s animal companion, using your oracle level as your effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence score of at least 6.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-erosion-touch"><em>Erosion Touch (Su)</em>: As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per level to objects or constructs. If used against an object in another creature’s possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one time per day for every three levels you possess.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-friend-to-the-animals"><em>Friend to the Animals (Ex)</em>: Add all <em>summon nature’s ally</em> spells to your spell list. You must still select these spells using your allotment of spells known. Animals within 30 feet of you receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-life-leach"><em>Life Leach (Su)</em>: You can draw life force from the bodies of enemies and channel it into yourself. As a standard action, you can drain the life essence from one living target within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per two levels you possess (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can’t gain more than the target’s current hit points + the target’s Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points last a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier. The target receives a Fortitude save to halve the damage (and the temporary hit points you gain). You may use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels you possess beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-natural-divination"><em>Natural Divination (Ex)</em>: You can read the entrails of a freshly killed animal or humanoid to gain an insight bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by observing and interpreting the flights of birds, you may apply a +10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, by charting marks in dirt or stone, or observing the behavior of sand when thrown into the wind, you gain a +4 insight bonus on one initiative check. These bonuses must be used during the next 24 hours and you must declare you are using the bonus before the check or save is made. Making a natural divination takes 10 minutes. You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus one additional time per day for every four oracle levels you have attained.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-natures-whispers"><em>Nature’s Whispers (Ex)</em>: You have become so attuned to the whispers of the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great boulders, that your surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-speak-with-animals"><em>Speak with Animals (Ex)</em>: Choose a specific kind of animal (eagle, fox, dog, and so on). You gain the ability to converse with that type of animal as if you were under the effects of <em>speak with animal</em>. You gain the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3 oracle levels you have attained.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-spirit-of-nature"><em>Spirit of Nature (Su)</em>: When in a natural setting, whenever you are reduced to negative hit points, you automatically stabilize. At 5th level, you gain fast healing 1 for 1d4 rounds whenever you are reduced to negative hit points. At 10th level, the ability works everywhere, even in civilized or wholly artificial realms. At 15th level, you gain fast healing 3 for 1d4 rounds when reduced to negative hit points.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-transcendental-bond"><em>Transcendental Bond (Su)</em>: You become so attuned to the common spirit shared by all living things that you can use it to communicate with allies. You may communicate with your allies for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level as if using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.telepathicbond.html#corerulebook-spells-telepathicbond-telepathic-bond"><span class="std std-ref">telepathic bond</span></a>. You may designate a number of creatures as your ally equal to your Charisma modifier. Designating a creature is a standard action that requires a touch. At 10th level, you may use this bond to cast a touch spell on a designated ally once per day.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-undo-artifice"><em>Undo Artifice (Sp)</em>: At 11th-level, you gain the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component parts, essentially erasing the hand of artifice and rendering the item into a pile of raw natural materials. This effect acts as the spell <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.polymorphanyobject.html#corerulebook-spells-polymorphanyobject-polymorph-any-object"><span class="std std-ref">polymorph any object</span></a>, working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.polymorphanyobject.html#corerulebook-spells-polymorphanyobject-polymorph-any-object"><span class="std std-ref">polymorph any object</span></a>, it cannot be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect. Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp in the item’s value. You may use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: At 20th level, you have discovered the intrinsic secrets of life itself, granting you incredible control over your own body. Once per day, you can surround yourself with an organic cocoon as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered helpless. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to plant, animal, or humanoid, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate (see the <em>PRD Bestiary</em>). This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Each time the transformation is made, you are cleansed of all poisons or diseases, are restored to full hit points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a new type every time the transformation is made.</p>

Your gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to your oracle level, or 1/12th this thickness of metal. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-earth-glide">Earth <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.spells.glide.html#advancedplayersguide-spells-glide-glide"><span class="std std-ref">Glide</span></a> (Su): You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.moveearth.html#corerulebook-spells-moveearth-move-earth"><span class="std std-ref">move earth</span></a> spell cast on an area where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can bring other creatures with you when you glide, but each passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.</p>

You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-rock-throwing">Rock <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.magicitems.weapons.html#corerulebook-magicitems-weapons-throwing"><span class="std std-ref">Throwing</span></a> (Ex): You are an accomplished rock thrower and have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown rocks.

You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-steelbreaker-skin"><em>Steelbreaker Skin (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can harden your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed.

You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. At 15th level, the damage from this ability ignores up to 10 points of hardness.</p>
<p id="advancedplayersguide-baseclasses-oracle-stone-stability"><em>Stone Stability (Ex)</em>: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground. At 5th level, you gain <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#improved trip (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Improved Trip</span></a> as a bonus feat.

At 7th level, while this ability is in effect, you can instead go underwater, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe water.
