<p>Most monks are mystic warriors, steeped in monastic traditions that fuse <em>ki</em> with martial prowess, though not all monks or monastic orders approach their mystic traditions and fighting forms in the same manner. There are even those—like the martial artist—who reject mystical traditions and seek the perfection of fighting forms without the need for <em>ki</em> mysteries. The following archetypes represent a number of ways in which monks throughout the world seek their personal and monastic forms of fighting perfection. Some, like the sensei, use their knowledge to grant wisdom to others, while the sohei and tetori represent relatively new fighting styles that surprise those who are more used to traditional monastic disciplines.</p>

<p>The flowing monk is the wind and the river. He knows how the world flows, and forces his enemies to flow with it. Even the most powerful stone breaks under the graceful and persistent pressure of wind and water.</p>

<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-redirection"><strong>Redirection (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk can attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver against a creature that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks him. If the combat maneuver is successful, the attacker is sickened for 1 round (Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + monk’s Wisdom modifier to halve the duration), plus 1 additional round at 4th level and for every four levels afterward (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). The monk gains a +2 bonus on the reposition or trip combat maneuver check and the save DC for redirection increases by 2 if the attacker is using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#power attack (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Power Attack</span></a> or is charging when attacking him. The benefit increases to a +4 bonus and an increase of the saving throw by 4 if both apply.</p>
<p>At 4th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against an opponent that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks an ally with a melee attack. At 8th level, a flowing monk can make both a reposition and a trip maneuver as part of a single immediate action with this ability. At 12th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against any opponent that attacks him in melee, even if the flowing monk is not threatening the opponent who attacks him. A flowing monk can use this ability once per day per monk level, but no more than once per round. This ability replaces stunning fist.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-unbalancing-counter"><strong>Unbalancing Counter (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a flowing monk’s attacks of opportunity render a struck creature flat-footed until the end of the flowing monk’s next turn (Reflex DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-flowing-dodge"><strong>Flowing Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a flowing monk gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each enemy adjacent to him, up to a maximum bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This ability replaces fast movement.</p>

At 11th level and above, the flowing monk suffers no damage on a successful save, or half damage on a failed save. If the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack hits the new target, that creatures  takes half damage (or full damage if the attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only half damage. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body.</p>

<p>The maneuver master specializes in more complicated moves than simple damage-dealing strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: In addition to normal monk bonus feats, a maneuver master may select any Improved combat maneuver feat (such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#improved overrun (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Improved Overrun</span></a>) as a bonus feat.

<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-flurry-of-maneuvers"><strong>Flurry of Maneuvers (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, as part of a full-attack action, a maneuver master can make one additional combat maneuver, regardless of whether the maneuver normally replaces a melee attack or requires a standard action. The maneuver master uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to determine his CMB for the bonus maneuvers, though all combat maneuver checks suffer a –2 penalty when using a flurry. At 8th level, a maneuver master may attempt a second additional combat maneuver, with an additional –3 penalty on combat maneuver checks. At 15th level, a maneuver master may attempt a third additional combat maneuver, with an additional –7 penalty on combat maneuver checks. A maneuver master loses this ability when wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load. This ability replaces flurry of blows.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-maneuver-defense"><strong>Maneuver Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, if a maneuver master has an Improved combat maneuver feat, any creature attempting that maneuver against the maneuver master provokes an attack of opportunity, even if it would not normally do so.

<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-pain-points"><strong>Pain Points (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a martial artist’s advanced knowledge of humanoid anatomy grants a +1 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls and increases the DC of his stunning fist and quivering palm by 1. This ability replaces still mind.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-martial-arts-master"><strong>Martial Arts Master (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a martial artist may use his monk level to qualify for feats with a fighter level prerequisite when those feats are applied to unarmed strikes or weapons with the monk special quality. This ability replaces slow fall.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-monk-exploit-weakness"><strong>Exploit Weakness (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, as a swift action, a martial artist can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by making a Wisdom check and adding his monk level against a DC of 10 + the object’s hardness or the target’s CR. If the check succeeds, the martial artist gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of his turn, and any attacks he makes until the end of his turn ignore the creature or object’s DR or hardness.</p>
<p>A martial artist may instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.sensemotive.html#corerulebook-skills-sensemotive-sense-motive"><span class="std std-ref">Sense Motive</span></a> checks and Reflex saves and a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 his monk level until the start of his next turn.</p>

<p>The master of many styles is a collector. For every move, he seeks a counter. For every style, he has a riposte. Ultimately, he seeks perfection through the fusion of styles.</p>
<p id="id2"><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At 1st level, 2nd level, and every four levels thereafter, a master of many styles may select a bonus style feat or the <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats.html#advancedplayersguide-advancedfeats-elemental-fist-combat"><span class="std std-ref">Elemental Fist</span></a> feat. He does not need to meet the prerequisites of that feat, except the <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats.html#advancedplayersguide-advancedfeats-elemental-fist-combat"><span class="std std-ref">Elemental Fist</span></a> feat. Starting at 6th level, a master of many styles can choose to instead gain a wildcard style slot. Whenever he enters one or more styles, he can spend his wildcard style slots to gain feats in those styles’ feat paths (such as <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#ultimatecombat-ultimatecombatfeats-earth-child-topple-combat"><span class="std std-ref">Earth Child Topple</span></a>) as long as he meets the prerequisites.

At 12th level, a sensei may affect all allies within 30 feet rather than himself (spending points from his <em>ki</em> pool only once, not once for each target).</p>
<p>At 10th level, a sensei may instead spend 1 point from his <em>ki</em> pool (as a swift action) while using advice to provide a single ally within 30 feet with evasion, fast movement, high jump, purity of body, or slow fall.
