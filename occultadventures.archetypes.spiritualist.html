<p>Spiritualists are strange individuals caught between the realities of the Material Plane and the eerie substance of the Ethereal Plane. Though most spiritualists harbor phantoms, others instead command different powers gained from their extraplanar connections.</p>
<div class="section" id="ectoplasmatist-archetype">
<span id="occultadventures-archetypes-spiritualist-ectoplasmatist-archetype"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Ectoplasmatist (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#ectoplasmatist-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Instead of calling upon a phantom from the Ethereal Plane, an ectoplasmatist infuses herself with the mysterious substance called ectoplasm.</p>
<p><strong>Ectoplasmic Lash (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, as a full-round action an ectoplasmatist can manifest one or two lashes of ectoplasm tethered to her by wispy, ectoplasmic tendrils. If she manifests two lashes, she can wield them both as light melee weapons, each dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19–20/×2. If the ectoplasmatist manifests only one lash, she can manifest it either as a single one-handed melee weapon that deals 1d8 points of slashing damage (1d6 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19–20/×2, or as a two-handed melee weapon that deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d10 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical multiplier of ×2. Only the ectoplasmatist can wield or use these lashes. Dismissing any or all manifested lashes is a free action.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, the ectoplasmatist’s lashes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and are treated as magic weapons.</p>
<p>At 4th level, the ectoplasmatist can use her lashes as reach weapons or use them to manipulate objects from a distance. When used as weapons, the lashes gain an additional 5 feet of reach. Unlike most other weapons with reach, the lashes can be used to attack foes anywhere within the ectoplasmatist’s reach (including adjacent foes). Attacks with the lashes’ extended reach provoke attacks of opportunity just as if the ectoplasmatist were attacking with a ranged weapon. When the lashes are used to manipulate items, they have the same manual dexterity as the ectoplasmatist’s hands. Using the lashes to manipulate items always provokes attacks of opportunity, even if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking normally wouldn’t.</p>
<p>At 6th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases to +2, and they are treated as having the ectoplasmatist’s alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>At 8th level, the ectoplasmatist’s lashes become <em>ghost touch</em> weapons and their reach increases by another 5 feet (for a total increase of 10 feet). Additionally, attacks with the lashes against nonadjacent foes no longer provoke attacks of opportunity. Using the lashes to manipulate objects from a distance still provokes attacks of opportunity, but only if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking would normally provoke such attacks (instead of always provoking).</p>
<p>At 10th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases to +3.</p>
<p>At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a single emotional focus (anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, or zeal). The ectoplasmatist’s lashes gain a special weapon ability as if affected by a <a class="reference internal" href="occultadventures.spells.spiritboundblade.html#occultadventures-spells-spiritboundblade-spirit-bound-blade"><span class="std std-ref">spirit-bound blade</span></a> spell matching the emotional energy of the focus the ectoplasmatist has chosen.</p>
<p>At 14th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p>At 16th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a second emotional focus, and her lashes gain the special weapon abilities as if affected by a <a class="reference internal" href="occultadventures.spells.spiritboundblade.html#occultadventures-spells-spiritboundblade-spirit-bound-blade"><span class="std std-ref">spirit-bound blade</span></a> spell with the special weapon ability of both of the ectoplasmatist’s chosen emotional foci.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases to +5.</p>
<p>This ability replaces etheric tether, phantom, shared consciousness, fused consciousness, spiritual bond, and empowered consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Combat (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, as a full-round action, an ectoplasmatist can make all of her attacks with a single light or one-handed ectoplasmic lash wielded in one hand, and also cast a single spiritualist spell with a casting time of one standard action as a free action either before or after making the ectoplasmic lash attacks. The ectoplasmatist takes a –2 penalty on her attack rolls when using spiritual combat. If she decides to cast the spell defensively, she can choose to take an additional penalty on her attack rolls up to her Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the concentration check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty.</p>
<p>Also, when the ectoplasmatist casts a spiritualist spell with a range of touch, she can deliver the spell through one of her ectoplasmic lashes. Instead of making the free melee touch attack she would normally use to deliver the spell, the ectoplasmatist can choose to make a free ectoplasmic lash attack at her highest base attack bonus. A successful lash attack deals damage normally and imparts the spell’s effects. The ectoplasmatist can’t hold the charge if her lash attack misses.</p>
<p>This ability replaces bonded manifestation, phantom recall, and dual bond.</p>
<p><strong>Ectoplasmic Armor (Su)</strong>: At 4th level when an ectoplasmatist manifests her spiritual lash ability, tendrils of ectoplasmic material envelop her body, granting her a +4 armor bonus to AC.</p>
<p>At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist’s armor bonus to AC increases to +6 and is treated as <em>ghost touch</em> armor.</p>
<p>This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.</p>

<div class="section" id="fractured-mind-archetype">
<span id="occultadventures-archetypes-spiritualist-fractured-mind-archetype"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Fractured Mind (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#fractured-mind-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most spiritualists harbor the spirits of the deceased in their psyches, but a small number of them—known as fractured minds—draw their powers instead from a fraction of their own souls that resonates with extremely powerful emotions. These spiritualists’ phantoms are not spiritual allies, but rather extensions of the fractured minds’ own inner thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Spellcasting</strong>: A fractured mind’s ability to cast spells is tied to the force of her own spirit rather than her connection to the spirit world. As a result, she uses her Charisma score rather than her Wisdom score to determine the highest spell level she can cast, the saving throw DCs of spells she casts, and her bonus spells per day. This ability alters spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Power (Sp)</strong>: The fractured mind gains a number of spell-like abilities, which are tied to her phantom’s emotional focus. She gains one spell-like ability at 5th level, a second at 7th level, a third at 9th level, and a fourth at 16th level. A fractured mind can use each of these abilities once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond the level at which she gained the spell-like ability. The saving throw DCs for these spell-like abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2 the fractured mind’s spiritualist class level + the fractured mind’s Charisma modifier, rather than being based on the spell’s level. The spell-like abilities granted by each emotional focus are listed below.</p>

<div class="section" id="geist-channeler-archetype">
<span id="occultadventures-archetypes-spiritualist-geist-channeler-archetype"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Geist Channeler (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#geist-channeler-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some phantoms retain less of their personalities and memories than others. Though most phantoms maintain some semblance of their former selves, others of their kind, known as geists, came close to being lost forever before they became phantoms. Incapable of manifesting in ectoplasmic form and devoid of human emotions, these strange entities are much closer to ghosts than most other phantoms. The spiritualists who work with them, known as geist channelers, are able to call on them in unique ways.</p>
<p><strong>Geistform Phantom (Su)</strong>: A geist channeler’s phantom can’t manifest in ectoplasmic form, and is limited to manifesting in incorporeal form. As a result, the phantom has no Strength score, and has a starting Wisdom score of 12. Instead of gaining two slam attacks, it gains only a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. The slam attack’s damage increases to 1d10 points at 5th level, to 2d6 at 10th level, to 2d8 at 15th level, and 2d10 at 20th level (assuming the phantom is Medium). The phantom does not gain the magic attacks ability at 4th level.</p>
<p>While manifested incorporeally, a geist channeler’s phantom can attack only other incorporeal creatures. Because the phantom is incorporeal, the damage it deals to such creatures is not reduced as a result of them being incorporeal. At 5th level, the phantom can take a swift action to infuse itself with trace amounts of ectoplasm so it can attack corporeal creatures for 1 round. During that time, it deals half damage to corporeal creatures with its slam, and corporeal creatures with nonmagical weapons deal half damage to the phantom. At 10th level, when the phantom infuses itself, its attacks deal normal damage to corporeal creatures.</p>
<p>This ability alters the phantom.</p>
<p><strong>Emotionless (Su)</strong>: A geist channeler’s phantom doesn’t have an emotional focus; instead, it is cold and devoid of emotions. The phantom gains a number of ranks in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (arcana) and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.knowledge.html#corerulebook-skills-knowledge-knowledge"><span class="std std-ref">Knowledge</span></a> (religion) equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler’s consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good Reflex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat, as well as the following abilities.</p>
<p><em>Unnerving Touch (Su)</em>: As a standard action, a geist channeler’s phantom can make a melee touch attack against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice + the phantom’s Charisma modifier) negates this effect. At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple attacks against the same creature don’t cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
<p><em>Poltergeist’s Knack (Sp)</em>: At 7th level, a geist channeler’s phantom can use <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.telekinesis.html#corerulebook-spells-telekinesis"><span class="std std-ref">telekinesis</span></a> as a spell-like ability. It can use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to the phantom’s Hit Dice.</p>
<p><em>Spectral Protection (Su)</em>: At 12th level as a standard action, while a geist channeler’s phantom is confined within his psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler’s spiritualist class level + the geist channeler’s Wisdom modifier) or be unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively, not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his spiritualist level. The minutes don’t need to be continuous, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
<p><em>Malevolent Possession (Sp)</em>: At 17th level, a geist channeler’s phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This functions as <a class="reference internal" href="occultadventures.spells.possession.html#occultadventures-spells-possession-possession"><span class="std std-ref">possession</span></a>. To use this ability, the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice + the phantom’s Charisma modifier). The phantom can use this ability once per day.</p>
<p>This ability modifies the phantom and replaces the phantom’s emotional focus.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Manifestation (Su)</strong>: Because of the nature of her phantom, a geist channeler can use the bonded manifestation ability to manifest his phantom only in incorporeal form. This ability alters bonded manifestation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="haunted-archetype">
<span id="occultadventures-archetypes-spiritualist-haunted-archetype"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Haunted (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#haunted-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The haunted are a dangerous breed of spellcasters bound to temperamental and unpredictable phantoms that leech power from their spiritualists.</p>
<p><strong>Usurp Manifestation (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, the haunted’s phantom begins to subtly subvert the relationship with its master, gaining rather than granting power from the connection. When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form, the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to draw upon the haunted’s body to strengthen its ectoplasmic might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order to increase its own power. The phantom must activate this ability as an immediate action at the start of the spiritualist’s turn, and it can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted’s spiritualist level. The rounds don’t need to be consecutive, and the phantom can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect, the haunted’s features become sunken and withdrawn, and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power, becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson.html#corerulebook-spells-enlargeperson-enlarge-person"><span class="std std-ref">enlarge person</span></a> spell) and increasing its natural armor bonus to AC by 2 for the effect’s duration. If the spiritualist prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn’t gain the benefits of usurp manifestation.</p>
<p>At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th levels), the phantom gains new abilities while using usurp manifestation.</p>
<p><em>Usurp Spell</em>: At 8th level, while using usurp manifestation, the phantom can leech spell slots from the haunted to increase its own power. The phantom can reach through the etheric tether as a swift action to drain the nauseated haunted’s psychic spell energy, effectively taking any touch spell or spell with a target of “you” that the haunted knows and casting it on itself (assuming the haunted has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level). This ability consumes two of the haunted’s spell slots of the appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.</p>
<p><em>Teleplasmic Surge</em>: At 13th level, when using usurp manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.</p>
<p><em>Ferocious Phantom</em>: At 18th level, when using usurp manifestation the phantom gains DR 10/slashing and spell resistance equal to 11 + the haunted’s spiritualist level (this spell resistance doesn’t apply to spells originating from the spiritualist or from the usurp spell ability).</p>
<p>This ability replaces bonded manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>Usurped Bond (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, the haunted’s phantom can use usurp manifestation for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + double the haunted’s spiritualist level. This ability replaces dual bond.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="onmyoji-archetype">
<span id="occultadventures-archetypes-spiritualist-onmyoji-archetype"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Onmyoji (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#onmyoji-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Though most spiritualists are chosen by their phantoms, others deliberately call phantoms to them through years of careful preparation and study in obscure divine traditions. These spiritualists, known as onmyoji, form close bonds with their phantoms, as any other spiritualist does, but see the phantoms as partners and tools in their work. Onmyoji serve as emissaries between the mundane world and the spiritual one, either working to ensure that troubles in the spiritual world do not spill over into the world of mortals, or stirring up spiritual trouble in order to achieve their ends among the living.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Spellcasting</strong>: An onmyoji’s spellcasting ability comes from divine rather than psychic power. As a divine caster, the onmyoji’s spells use verbal components instead of thought components, and somatic components instead of emotional components, and she uses an ofuda as a divine focus. Ofudas are scrolls with holy writings written on parchment, cloth, or wood (having the same cost as a wooden holy symbol) or metal (having the same cost as a silver holy symbol). This ability alters spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Resistance (Su)</strong>: An onmyoji’s phantom provides her with protection from supernatural forces. While the phantom is confined within the onmyoji’s consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested), it grants her a +2 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey, outsiders, and incorporeal undead. At 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces shared consciousness and fused consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Teachings (Su)</strong>: An onmyoji gains the ability to call upon her phantom to help her cast spells she normally couldn’t. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an onmyoji can choose a single spell from the cleric spell list with a spell level she is currently able to cast, and add that spell to her list of spells known, at the same spell level as it appears on the cleric spell list. Because the onmyoji relies on her phantom’s influence in order to cast these spells, she can cast spells added in this way only while the phantom is confined within her consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested). This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.</p>
