<span id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-weapons"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Weapons</a><a class="headerlink" href="#weapons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Without a doubt, weapons number among adventurers’ most coveted possessions. Whether weapons are used as tools to lay foul monsters low, as the medium for magical enhancements,  or as outlets for a host of fundamental class abilities, few heroes head into the field without their favorite—or perhaps even a whole arsenal of their favorites. This section presents all manner of nonmagical weapons for PCs to purchase and put to use, whatever their adventures might entail. The weapons presented here should be relatively easy to find and purchase in most towns and cities, although GMs might wish to restrict the availability of some of the more expensive and exotic items.</p>
<p>All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll exceeds the target’s AC, the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.</p>
<p>Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).</p>
<p><strong>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons</strong>: Most character classes are proficient with all simple weapons. Combat-oriented classes such as barbarians, cavaliers, and fighters are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons they gain from their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Melee and Ranged Weapons</strong>: Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons include thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Reach Weapons:</em> Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, and whips are examples of reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>
<p><em>Double Weapons:</em> Dire flails, gnome hooked hammers, and two-bladed swords are examples of double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
The character can also choose to use a double weapon two-handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p><em>Thrown Weapons:</em> Daggers, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, and nets are examples of thrown weapons. The wielder applies his Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn’t have a numeric entry in the Range column on the following weapon tables), and a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Projectile Weapons:</em> Blowguns, crossbows, shortbows, slings, longbows, and halfling sling staves are examples of projectile weapons—weapons that launch ammunition at a target. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character cannot apply his Strength modifier on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a sling or a specially built composite shortbow or composite longbow. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when she uses a bow or a sling.
<em>Ammunition:</em> Projectile weapons use ammunition, such as arrows for bows, bolts for crossbows, darts for blowguns, or sling bullets for slings and halfling sling staves. When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</div></blockquote>
<p>Although shuriken are thrown weapons, they are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons</strong>: This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Light:</em> A light weapon is used in one hand. It is easier to use in one’s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and can be used while grappling. Add the wielder’s Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or half the wielder’s Strength modifier if it’s used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength modifier applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder’s primary hand only.</div></blockquote>
<p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>One-Handed:</em> A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or half his Strength modifier if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength modifier to damage rolls made with that weapon.
<em>Two-Handed:</em> Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Weapon Size</strong>: Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Inappropriately Sized Weapons</em>: A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon, a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.</div></blockquote>
<p>The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature wields a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon (it still takes the –2 penalty for using an inappropriately sized weapon). If a weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.</p>
<p><strong>Improvised Weapons</strong>: Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat—commonly bottles, chair legs, stray femurs, and that sort of thing. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a critical threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<div class="section" id="weapon-qualities">
<span id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-weapon-qualities"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Weapon Qualities</a><a class="headerlink" href="#weapon-qualities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: This value is the weapon’s price in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The price includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon, such as a scabbard or quiver.</p>
<p>This price is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.</p>
<p><strong>Dmg</strong>: These columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled “Dmg (S)” is for Small weapons. The column labeled “Dmg (M)” is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given in the same column, then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon’s extra attack. Table 1–8: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for Tiny and Large weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Critical</strong>: The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.</p>
<p>Extra damage over and above a weapon’s normal damage (such as sneak attack damage or bonus damage from the flaming weapon quality) is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>×2</em>: The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit. Some weapons deal triple or quadruple damage.
<em>×2/×3</em>: One head of this double weapon deals double damage on a critical hit. The other head deals triple damage. Some double weapons’ heads deal triple and quadruple damage on a critical hit.
<em>19–20/×2</em>: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. Some weapons score a threat on a natural 18 as well, or deal triple instead of double damage on a critical hit.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a –4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot up to 10 range increments.</p>
<p><strong>Weight</strong>: This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons; double it for Large weapons. Some weapons have a special weight. See the weapon’s description for details.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.</p>
<p>Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; rather, all damage caused is considered to be of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.</p>
<p>In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon. For example, the damage caused by a dagger depends on whether the wielder is thrusting to deal piercing damage or slicing to deal slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Blocking:</em> When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.
<em>Brace:</em> If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging creature.
<em>Deadly:</em> When you use this weapon to deliver a coup de grace, it gains a +4 bonus to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.
<em>Disarm:</em> When you use this weapon, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm an enemy.
<em>Distracting:</em> You gain a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.bluff.html#corerulebook-skills-bluff-bluff"><span class="std std-ref">Bluff</span></a> skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.
<em>Double:</em> You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
<em>Fragile:</em> Fragile weapons cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description.</div></blockquote>
<p>If a weapon gains the broken condition in this way, that weapon is considered to have taken damage equal to half its hit points +1. This damage is repaired either by something that addresses the effect that granted the weapon the broken condition (like quick clear in the case of firearm misfires or the <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#ultimatecombat-ultimatecombatfeats-field-repair"><span class="std std-ref">Field Repair</span></a> feat) or by the repair methods described in the broken condition. When an effect that grants the broken condition is removed, the weapon regains the hit points it lost when the broken condition was applied. Damage done by an attack against a weapon (such as from a sunder combat maneuver) cannot be repaired by an effect that removes the broken condition.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Grapple:</em> On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the creature using a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away that the creature you’re grappling is no longer within the weapon’s reach, you end the grapple with that action.
<em>Monk:</em> A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows.
<em>Nonlethal:</em> These weapons deal nonlethal damage.
<em>Performance:</em> When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a performance combat check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check.
<em>Reach:</em> You can use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
<em>Trip:</em> When you use a trip weapon to make a trip attack, if you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="masterwork-weapons">
<span id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-masterwork-weapons"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Masterwork Weapons</a><a class="headerlink" href="#masterwork-weapons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>Without using magic, you can’t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.craft.html#corerulebook-skills-craft-craft"><span class="std std-ref">Craft</span></a> skill). The masterwork transformation spell transforms a non-masterwork weapon into a masterwork weapon.</p>
<p>The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).</p>
<p>Masterwork ammunition is damaged (and effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.</p>
<p>All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn’t stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon’s magic.</p>
<p>Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>The aklys is a hooked throwing club with a 20-foot-long cord, usually of woven leather; you can retrieve the aklys after throwing it as a move action. The hook allows you to make trip attacks at range. Some aklyses have holes drilled through them and whistle when flung.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>—</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>An amentum is a long leather thong that attaches to a standard javelin. Before throwing, the amentum is wound about the javelin’s shaft. You then throw the javelin while gripping the amentum, imparting spin on the weapon and greatly improving its range. Attaching an amentum to a javelin is a move action, and winding it is a full-round action. Javelins can be stored with amenta already wound about them. A javelin wound with an amentum is considered a martial weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp (20)</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>2 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>This Stone Age weapon is a thin piece of wood or antler used as a lever to hurl a specially fitted dart. An atlatl gives much greater range to a dart, but must be loaded like a projectile weapon. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use an atlatl, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire—but not load—an atlatl with one hand. Loading an atlatl is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#rapid reload (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Rapid Reload</span></a> feat can be taken for atlatls, allowing you to load a dart as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>An atlatl dart is the equivalent of a javelin except it has fletching. If thrown without an atlatl, treat it as a javelin.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp (10)</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>These foot-long arrows are used as ammunition for arrow tubes. As an improvised melee weapon, they deal damage equivalent to that of a spiked gauntlet. They come in a bamboo tube that holds 10 shafts.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>13 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>The crescent axe-blade of this polearm is attached to the haft at two points: the center of the blade attaches to a socket at the top of the haft, and the lower point of the blade attaches to a secondary mount point. The blade is often very long, sometimes almost as long as the haft. You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD to resist sunder attempts made against a bardiche.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>35 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>A bastard sword is about 4 feet in length, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. You can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon’s head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>10 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes ranging from half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of woodcutting axes. The wooden haft may be protected and strengthened with metal bands called langets.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>Bayonets are close combat weapons designed to fit into the grooves or muzzles of crossbows and firearms. They allow you to make melee attacks with these weapons but render them temporarily useless as ranged weapons. Attaching or removing a bayonet is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>15 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>The bec de corbin is a polearm very similar to the lucerne hammer, but the hammer head is slightly blunter and the spike is stouter and more hooked. You primarily attack with the spike. You gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder medium or heavy armor with a bec de corbin.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>11 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>The blade of this polearm is a curved or hooked chopping blade with a spiked projection on the back of the blade. The spike is commonly used to block and parry. When fighting defensively or with full defense, this weapon gives you a +1 shield bonus to AC. A mounted opponent hit by a bill takes a –1 penalty on his <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.ride.html#corerulebook-skills-ride-ride"><span class="std std-ref">Ride</span></a> check to stay mounted.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>2 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>Blowguns are generally used to deliver debilitating (but rarely fatal) poisons from a distance. They are nearly silent when fired. For a list of appropriate poisons, see Poisons on page 110.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 sp (10)</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>The thin, light darts used in a blowgun are usually made of hardwood with a stabilizing fletching of down or fur. A dart is usually loaded from the back end just before firing.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>2 gp (20)</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>These arrows have rounded wooden tips that deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. An archer can use a blunt arrow to deal nonlethal damage (at the normal –4 attack penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage).</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>Similar to a quarterstaff, only more slender and tapered at one end, the bo staff is both a defensive device and a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>This spear has a metal crossbar to protect you against onrushing attackers. If you ready a boar spear against a charge and your attack hits, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC against that creature until your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>A bolas is a pair of wooden, stone, or metal weights connected by a thin rope or cord. You can whirl and throw this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can’t be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>3 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is made of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve, and a sharp backward bend at the head. A hunting boomerang does not fly in a returning path.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a spell with a somatic component while wearing brass knuckles if you make a successful concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you’re casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can’t be disarmed.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>20 GP (2)</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder’s hand. The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords. Masterwork butterfly swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement bonuses or properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a pair of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp).</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, you can have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a –2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand (such as opening locks). A cestus can’t be disarmed.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>15 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>This vicious weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>The chakram is a simple, elegant, and highly portable thrown weapon. It is a flat, open-centered metal discus with a sharpened edge. You can wield the chakram as a melee weapon, but it is not designed for such use; you take a –1 penalty on your attack roll with the weapon and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or cut yourself on the blade (half damage, no Strength modifier). You do not need to make this save if wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>—</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>This weapon is usually just a shaped piece of wood, sometimes with a few nails or studs embedded in it.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>100 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use it with proficiency). If your Strength modifier is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow. A composite longbow fires arrows.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Weapon Proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>75 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength modifier is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow. A composite shortbow fires arrows.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Weapon Proficiency, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#weapon focus (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Weapon Focus</span></a>, and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 GP (10)</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts. All crossbows except repeating crossbows use these kinds of crossbow bolts, which are sometimes called “quarrels.”</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>2 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two. Dagger designs vary widely, and can have many different names (such as a thrusting dagger being called a “dirk”). You get a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand.html#corerulebook-skills-sleightofhand-sleight-of-hand"><span class="std std-ref">Sleight of Hand</span></a> skill checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 sp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>These short, blunt sticks are held in the hands to enhance unarmed martial techniques and secured by a cord looped over the thumb. They provide the wielder with the ability to lock an opponent and target pressure points, granting you a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 sp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> simple</p>
<p>This thrown weapon is larger than an arrow and shorter than a javelin, with a weighted tip and a shorter range than a javelin. Most darts are wooden shafts with a thick metal point.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>90 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but powerful strikes, and is typically swung in a constant churning motion. The wielder of a dire flail must have great strength, both to use the weapon effectively and to keep from tiring out.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>8 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>This short, curved blade was created by goblins, who often drill numerous holes into it in an attempt to reduce its weight. Most dogslicers are sized for Small creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>12 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> martial</p>
<p>The tip of this 3-foot-long, straight-bladed sword is bent into two staggered, opposing sharpened spurs that can be used to pull weapons from an opponent’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>300 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll if you’re proficient with it, or –8 if you’re not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#rapid reload (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Rapid Reload</span></a> feat reduces this to a move action. <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats.html#crossbow mastery (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Crossbow Mastery</span></a> allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>50 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> exotic</p>
<p>This single case conceals a pair of matched fighting swords perfectly balanced to be wielded as a pair. Despite their name, the blades more closely resemble the shorter wakizashi. When the blades are concealed in their case, this weapon can be used as a quarterstaff.</p>

<p>A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon—an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh’s axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon; the other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>

<p>A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net’s maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level or be unable to cast the spell.</p>
<p>An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.escapeartist.html#corerulebook-skills-escapeartist-escape-artist"><span class="std std-ref">Escape Artist</span></a> check (a full-round action).

<p>A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the blades at either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe in the middle of its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or battleaxe.</p>

<p>This section presents an anachronistic collection of hand-held black powder weapons suitable for a wide variety of fantasy adventure campaigns. Most of them are single-shot muzzle-loaders with highly inefficient triggering mechanisms—traditional sword and sorcery firearms. More advanced firearms are also presented for those brave enough to mix their fantasy with a technology much closer to that of the Old West than the slow and unstable weapons that gave musketeers their name. Of course, it is the GM’s decision whether or not guns of any type are allowed in a campaign.</p>
<p>What follows are additional rules for using firearms.</p>
<p><strong>Firearm Proficiency</strong>: The <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#exotic weapon proficiency (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</span></a> (firearms) feat allows you to use all firearms without penalty. A nonproficient character takes the standard –4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots he loads.</p>
<p>Even though the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#exotic weapon proficiency (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</span></a> (firearms) feat grants you proficiency with all firearms, anytime you take a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#weapon focus (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Weapon Focus</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#rapid reload (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Rapid Reload</span></a>), you must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.</p>
<p>All firearms are part of the same weapon group for the purposes of the fighter’s weapon training class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Firearm Categories</strong>: The firearms in this chapter fall into one of two categories: early or advanced firearms.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Early Firearms:</em> Early firearms are typically matchlock, wheellock, or flintlock weapons, and require more finesse and care to use than advanced firearms. Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring a bullet and powder (or other special alchemical substances) to be shoved down the barrel before the weapon is fired. Early firearm ammunition can be loaded from a cartridge, but that cartridge is made of soft material (like paper or cloth) that is torn open so that the contents may be shoved down the barrel.
<em>Advanced Firearms:</em> Advanced firearms are more reliable and accurate than early firearms. The ammunition for an advanced firearm takes the form of metal (usually brass) cartridges that are loaded into a chamber rather than shoved down the muzzle.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong>: A firearm’s capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit, unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action. In the case of early firearms, capacity often indicates the number of barrels a firearm has. In the case of advanced firearms, it typically indicates the number of chambers the weapon has.</p>
<p><strong>Range and Penetration</strong>: Armor, whether manufactured or natural, provides little protection against the force of a bullet at short range.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Early Firearms:</em> When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target’s touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#deadly aim (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Deadly Aim</span></a>. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.
<em>Advanced Firearms:</em> Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#deadly aim (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Deadly Aim</span></a>. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative –2 penalty for each full-range increment. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of 10 range increments.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Loading a Firearm</strong>: You need at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other—you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#rapid reload (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Rapid Reload</span></a> feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Early Firearms:</em> Early firearms are all muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm.
<em>Advanced Firearms:</em> Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Misfires</strong>: If the natural result of your attack roll with a firearm is equal to or less than the firearm’s misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm. In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Early Firearms:</em> If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can’t fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#ultimatecombat-ultimatecombatfeats-gunsmithing"><span class="std std-ref">Gunsmithing</span></a> feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square—the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each early firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm’s wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon—a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.
<em>Advanced Firearms:</em> Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A subsequent misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ammunition</strong>: Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used. Unlike other types of ammunition, there is no chance to retrieve firearm ammunition that misses. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Concealing Firearms</strong>: Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on your person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on your person.</p>
<p><strong>Bucklers</strong>: You can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty while carrying a buckler.</p>
<p><strong>Fire while Prone</strong>: Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.</p>
<p><strong>Firearms, Black Powder, and Water</strong>: Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. You cannot normally load an early firearm underwater or fire any firearm underwater without magical aid.</p>
<p><strong>Deflecting and Snatching Bullets</strong>: The Deflect Arrows feat and the <a class="reference internal" href="bestiary.monsterfeats.html#bestiary-monsterfeats-snatch"><span class="std std-ref">Snatch</span></a> Arrows feat can be used to deflect bullets, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Scatter (Weapon Quality)</strong>: A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise. When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack roll takes a –2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#vital strike (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Vital Strike</span></a>. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A firearm that makes a scatter shot misfires only if all of the attack rolls are misfires. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.</p>

<p>An alchemical cartridge is a prepared bundle of black powder with a bullet or pellets, sometimes with more exotic material added, which is then wrapped in paper or cloth and sealed with beeswax, lard, or tallow. There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge—a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>
<p id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-dragons-breath-cartridge"><em>Dragon’s Breath Cartridge</em>: This cartridge contains alchemical compounds that, when fired, produce a cone of fire instead of the normal attack of a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don’t have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.</p>
<p id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-entangling-shot-cartridge"><em>Entangling Shot Cartridge</em>: This mix of black powder and an alchemically treated resin strong enough to survive the shot can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or another scatter weapon. It deals half damage to those hit by a cone attack made with this weapon, but any creature hit by the shot must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 2d4 rounds. An entangling shot cartridge increases the firearm’s misfire value by 2.</p>
<p id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-flare-cartridge"><a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.flare.html#corerulebook-spells-flare-flare"><span class="std std-ref">Flare</span></a> Cartridge: When a flare cartridge hits its target, it deals only half the normal damage, but the creature struck is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 reduces this to dazzled), and creatures within a 20-foot burst are dazzled for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates the effect). Flare cartridges are also useful for sending up signal flares. Firing a flare cartridge increases the firearm’s misfire value by 2 unless it is fired from a blunderbuss or a dragon pistol, in which case doing so only increases the firearm’s misfire value by 1. Flares can be used only to attack single creatures; they do not work as a shot for a scatter weapon’s cone attack.</p>
<p id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-paper-cartridge"><em>Paper Cartridge</em>: This simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet increases the misfire value by 1.</p>
<p id="ultimateequipment-armsandarmor-weapons-salt-shot-cartridge"><em>Salt Shot Cartridge</em>: This mix of black powder and rock salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases the misfire value by 1. You can use it only with a scatter weapon’s cone attack.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1,600 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This short musket features an axe blade at the end of its barrel. It can be used as both a musket and a battleaxe. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the axe are considered broken. An axe musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>

<p>Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that enables it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can be quite destructive on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode—a single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>2,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This weapon fires pellets or a bullet from its trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an effective fowling weapon or close-fighting personal defense weapon. The blunderbuss fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A blunderbuss uses a bullet or pellets and a single dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>750 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled pistol, you can shoot only one barrel at a time. You must remove the buckler to reload the gun. Each barrel of a buckler gun uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its awkward construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>750 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>Though less powerful than other, larger firearms, this pistol is small enough to be easily concealed in a jacket or coat. You get a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand.html#corerulebook-skills-sleightofhand-sleight-of-hand"><span class="std std-ref">Sleight of Hand</span></a> checks made to conceal a coat pistol on your body. A coat pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>4,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>The culverin, also known as a hand bombard, consists of a simple smoothbore tube, sealed at one end except for a small hole used to ignite a gunpowder charge. A wooden stock partially encases the barrel, allowing you to hold it under your arm with relative ease when carrying it. Firing a culverin without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, and knocks you prone. A culverin uses 4 doses of black powder and grapeshot (a handful of pellets) as ammunition. Note that these statistics simulate only the original, hand-held culverins—their larger descendants are considered cannons and are dealt with in the siege weapon section of <em>Ultimate Combat</em>. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>740 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>A combination of a coat pistol and a blade, the dagger pistol can be used as both weapons. The awkwardness of the configuration means you do not gain the bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand.html#corerulebook-skills-sleightofhand-sleight-of-hand"><span class="std std-ref">Sleight of Hand</span></a> checks that either of those stand-alone weapons grants. The dagger pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the dagger component are considered broken. A dagger pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>4,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This double-length rifle uses a pair of trunnions to mount its barrel into a swiveling mechanism fastened to the top of a lightweight, two-wheeled carriage. It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability during combat. Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a –4 penalty on attack rolls and the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut one size smaller than itself without the gun’s mounting as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>2,500 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot independently as a separate action, or both can be fired at once as the same attack. If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a –4 penalty on each shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1,750 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This pistol has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be fired independently as a separate action, or both can be shot at once with the same action. If both barrels are shot at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the pistol becomes wildly inaccurate, imposing a –4 penalty on each shot. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>7,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> advanced</p>
<p>This twin-barreled shotgun can be shot one barrel at a time, or both together as one attack. A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate, and takes a –4 penalty on both attacks. A double shot that fires bullets targets only a single creature and increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small) or 2d8 points (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A double-barreled shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>Like a miniature blunderbuss, the dragon pistol fires pellets or a bullet from its flared barrel. The dragon pistol fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A dragon pistol uses either a bullet or group of pellets and 1 dose of black powder, or a single alchemical cartridge (with either bullets or pellets) as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>25 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This primitive firearm is merely a long tube that, when ignited, propels forth a short gout of flame and a javelin. Unlike other firearms, the fire lance is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. A fire lance uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>The ammunition of most one-handed and two-handed firearms, firearm bullets typically take the form of small balls of lead or some other metal. Thirty bullets weigh half a pound.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>15 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>These sturdier versions of alchemical cartridges serve as the ammunition for advanced firearms. They can hold either bullets or pellets.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1,500 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This long-barreled firearm has a much greater range than a pistol. A musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as its ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>A handful of pellets, along with 1 dose of black powder, is commonly used as ammunition for one-handed and two-handed firearms with the scatter weapon quality, though rocks or other small bits of hard material can be used in the pellets’ place. Using anything other than pellets or alchemical cartridges when firing off a cone attack with a scatter weapon increases the weapon’s misfire range by 1 (though this increase can be removed by switching back to standard ammunition). Thirty handfuls of pellets weigh half a pound.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>3,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This pistol has six barrels instead of one. The entire barrel housing can be quickly rotated by hand between shots (a free action requiring one free hand), allowing all six bullets to be fired before the weapon must be reloaded. Each barrel of a pepperbox uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>7,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> advanced</p>
<p>The four barrels of this rifle are set into a turnable housing that can be quickly rotated by hand (a free action) between shots. A pepperbox rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>The basic single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms, although in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy or curiosity to most. As such, it can take a variety of different forms, from wildly ornate masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to the more common wood-handled pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal tube with a triggering device.</p>
<p>A pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> ammunition</p>
<p>This ammunition is pitted with a pattern of small pocks into which specially formulated poison compounds can be applied. A poison compound is a derivative of a standard toxin that is alchemically reduced to a solid form. These can be made from any standard injury or contact poison with a successful <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.craft.html#corerulebook-skills-craft-craft"><span class="std std-ref">Craft</span></a> (poison) check equal to the poison’s DC + 4. The cost of purchasing an already prepared poison compound for the purpose of treating pitted bullets is equal to the poison’s base cost + 20 gp. Once crafted, the compound can be pasted into the ammunition’s pitted design and allowed to harden. Upon completion, the bullet can be fired from an appropriate firearm, releasing the poison compound into its target upon impact, but the poison’s DC is reduced by 2. A pitted bullet cannot be used with an alchemical cartridge. The listed cost does not include the cost of poison.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>4,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> advanced</p>
<p>A revolver is a pistol with a revolving cylinder containing six chambers. Each chamber can hold a metal cartridge, and when one cartridge is fired, the cylinder automatically rotates (no extra hand or action required), readying the next chamber for firing. A revolver uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> advanced</p>
<p>This improvement on the musket features a grooved barrel that imparts a twisting, spiral motion to the bullet as it exits, stabilizing it and preventing the end-over-end tumbling common to projectiles from simpler firearms. As a result, a rifle can fire significantly farther and with more accuracy than early long-bore firearms.</p>
<p>A rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>5,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> advanced</p>
<p>This advanced version of the blunderbuss shoots in a 30-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 20-foot range increment when firing a bullet (often called a slug). Shotguns can either be simple and functional, or art pieces in their own right, with engravings and inlay on the stocks and breeches. Those used by the upper class are often emblazoned with images of game animals, family crests, or elaborate maker’s marks.</p>
<p>A shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>775 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane. The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol attachment makes the nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide. An observer must succeed at a DC 15 <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> check to realize that an undrawn sword cane pistol is a weapon rather than a simple walking stick; the DC decreases to 5 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part of the weapon must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>1,600 gp</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> early</p>
<p>This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon.
