Ratfolk
********

Living on the fringes of societies, ratfolk make a place for themselves through shrewd trading. They aren't powerful individually, but their large collectives give them both strength in numbers and the constant support of their families and loved ones. Though ratfolk can subdue enemies by swarming in combat, the greater threat comes from their inventiveness and collections of dangerous trinkets.

The typical ratfolk must withstand a riot of conflicting desires that result from generations of communal living, keen intellects, and lives spent adapting to a multitude of environments. Ratfolk are short-lived but populous; many ratfolk pregnancies result in twins or triplets, so warrens can grow very quickly if provided a steady supply of food and economic opportunities. Yet despite their large populations, ratfolk warrens tend to be relatively compact. This is more a matter of choice than necessity, as the creatures are naturally gregarious and enjoy the company of others, including rats and similar rodents—which ratfolk's natural empathy allows them to handle with ease. Although ratfolk respect other cultures' concepts of personal space, among their own kind, they think little of squeezing past one another, crowding into a small space, or clambering over family members with little warning.

Ratfolk have highly developed brains that quickly process, memorize, and analyze new information. In particular, ratfolk have exceptional spatial reasoning, understanding of causality, and raw curiosity. These traits not only enable them to predict how a material or device might change when manipulated in a particular way, but also encourage them to experiment unceasingly in times of peril and plenty. Although ratfolk live a meager fraction of the time that a human does, few of them fret about their brief lifespans; instead, they make up for it by spending much of their "idle" time exploring, experimenting, and experiencing what life has to offer.

This eagerness to explore also manifests in ratfolk's relationships with each other, for even though each member values the community, she also endeavors to distinguish herself through her own accomplishments. The constant bustle of ratfolk pursuing their own projects creates a chaotic environment, yet despite their seemingly self-absorbed motivations, ratfolk research and tinker with the intention of using their inventions to strengthen the community and give it an edge in survival. They praise the achievements of individuals, and it is considered good manners for the one celebrated to recognize the host of others who helped her accomplish her goal, reinforcing the community's bonds.

Ratfolk names are often short—a necessity when families are large and an adult must call out many names at once. If several ratfolk in a community have the same name, which is not uncommon, they're differentiated via nicknames. To further distinguish themselves, ratfolk wear unique jewelry or clothing with distinctive embroidery, or they may apply modest amounts of perfume to stand out.

Outside the warren, ratfolk make a living through trade, and their demeanors change: the playfulness fades in favor of businesslike professionalism, and their curiosity and skills of observation are used to study those with whom they trade. They take care to observe cultural taboos and traditions wherever they go, and sometimes cover themselves so as not to discourage closed-minded customers. A trade caravan might travel for a year or more before returning to the warren. Embarking on a trade mission is an exciting prospect for younger ratfolk, who use the experience as an unofficial rite of passage as well as a chance to study other races' technology. It is not uncommon for a handful of ratfolk to leave the caravan along the way in search of local opportunities.

The nearly incomprehensible bustle of a crowded warren belies the race's capacity to operate in an organized fashion. An outside threat quickly mobilizes ratfolk to defend their home. Warrens tend to be a jumble of narrow tunnels that connect larger living spaces, and defenders can fend off large numbers of attackers at strategic choke points. Years of living cheek by jowl allow ratfolk to fight in close proximity without interfering with one another; in fact, intruders often find it difficult to defend against the unpredictable attacks of a swarm of the small humanoids. Tunnels typically have easily removable supports near the warren so the ratfolk can collapse some entrances when attacked. As many of the adults hold off the attackers, others uncover escape routes and shepherd the young, sick, and weak to safety.

Despite their high population density, ratfolk settlements are kept remarkably clean. It is unclear whether the cleanliness or scientific understanding came first, but ratfolk alchemists have an excellent understanding of disease and how it spreads, leading to the development of complex sanitation procedures that reduce the risk of a plague sweeping through the crowded populace. This meticulousness does not always translate into organization, though, and an immaculately clean workshop might still be a jumble of tools, half-finished projects, and esoteric blueprints.

Ratfolk love to accumulate baubles, devices, and other small but exciting treasures. They place particularly high value on shiny objects—especially adornments like rings—and delicate mechanisms that can be disassembled, studied, and then pieced back together. Ratfolk practice a system of loose ownership in which one may borrow another's possession so long as it is returned when asked and taking it would not endanger its owner. This detachment makes ratfolk willing to trade away even prized possessions so long as doing so means gaining something even better. Ratfolk's love of shiny things illustrates another contradiction—while they delight in radiance, they favor living in dark places. A sparkling trinket is certain to fascinate ratfolk, but a bright flash of light or unexpected glow unsettles them.

Alternate Racial Traits
************************

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing ratfolk racial traits.

\ **Cheek Pouches**\ : Some ratfolk have developed stretchy cheek pouches that they can use to hold and carry small loads up to 1 cubic foot in volume and 10 pounds in weight, such as light weapons, potions, scrolls, and similar objects. Such a ratfolk can transfer a held object to his cheek pouches or extract an object from his cheek pouches as a swift action. As a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the ratfolk can instead massage all of the items held in the cheek pouches onto the ground in the square it occupies. As long as the ratfolk has at least one object in its cheek pouches, its speech is difficult to understand, and it has a 20% spell failure chance when casting spells with verbal components. This racial trait replaces swarming.

\ **Cleanliness**\ : Ratfolk strive to keep themselves and each other immaculately clean, to make it difficult for disease to spread. A ratfolk with this racial trait gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease, and whenever she exceeds the save DC to recover from a disease effect by 5 or more, she is treated as though she had succeeded at two consecutive saving throws. This racial trait replaces rodent empathy.

\ **Lab Rat**\ : For every ingenious ratfolk inventor, there is another who must inevitably test the invention. Those who survive enough experiments sometimes develop strange metabolic quirks that grant them heightened resilience and, on occasion, fortunate side effects when consuming alchemical or magical draughts. As a result, they gain a +1 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, alchemical weapons, and harmful effects from drinking potions or elixirs. In addition, once per day such a ratfolk can either increase the caster level of a potion he consumes by 1 or double the duration of an alchemical remedy he consumes or applies to himself (to a maximum of 4 hours). This racial trait replaces tinker.

\ **Surface Sprinter**\ : Some ratfolk spend as much time as they can aboveground and become very fast runners. This comes at the cost of their night vision, which becomes less acute after years of sunlight. These ratfolk gain low-light vision and have a base speed of 30 feet. This racial trait replaces darkvision and slow speed.

Ratfolk Feats
**************

Ratfolk have access to the following feats.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#gnawer`:

Gnawer
=======

Thanks to your teeth's strength and quick growth, you are able to chew through nearly any obstacle given sufficient time.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Sharptooth \*, ratfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : Damage dealt by your bite attack ignores an amount of hardness equal to 3 plus half your character level. You can spend a full-round action to deal double your bite damage to an unattended, inanimate object.

\ **Special**\ : If you have the Burrowing Teeth feat, you can burrow through solid stone at a speed of 5 feet per 10 minutes.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#pack_rat`:

Pack Rat
=========

You collect all sorts of things, and frequently lose and refind things you acquired.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Ratfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item, you happen to have such an item on your person. The item must cost no more than 25 gp plus 5 gp per level, and you must pay its cost when you "find" it (in other words, the money you thought you had on your person was actually the item). The item must be something you can easily carry—for example, if you are on foot and have only a backpack, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You can't find magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and acquire new items.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#shared_stash`: `monstercodex.ratfolk#shared_stash_(teamwork)`_

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#shared_stash_(teamwork)`:

Shared Stash (Teamwork)
========================

You are adept at borrowing from your allies even in the middle of combat.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Quick Draw <corerulebook.feats#quick_draw>`\ , base attack bonus +1, :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\  1 rank, swarming racial trait.

\ **Benefit**\ : While you are in the same square as a willing ally who also has this feat, you can draw a weapon from that creature as a free action or draw a hidden weapon or any other object as a move action. You can also take a held object from a willing ally in the same square as you as a free action. Drawing or taking an object (but not a weapon) in this way provokes an attack of opportunity.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#sharptooth`:

Sharptooth
===========

Your teeth are especially sharp and sturdy.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Ratfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of damage.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#ratfolk_equipment`:

Ratfolk Equipment
******************

Ratfolk have access to the following equipment.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#rhinarium_paste`:

Rhinarium Paste
================

\ **Price**\  75 gp; \ **Weight**\  1/2 lb.

When applied to the nose as a standard action, this alchemical paste traps airborne particles and sharpens your olfactory receptors, heightening your sense of smell. You gain the scent ability, except you can detect creatures and odors at only half the distance. If you already have the scent ability, rhinarium paste increases the range at which you can detect creatures by 50%. Rhinarium paste's effects lasts for 1 hour. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) check.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#riding_rat`:

Riding Rat
===========

\ **Common**\ : \ *Price*\  50 gp; \ *Weight*\  50 lbs.

\ **Combat trained**\ : \ *Price*\  75 gp; \ *Weight*\  50 lbs.

Horses, ponies, and other draft animals are ill-suited to living underground for long stretches, so the ratfolk bred a particularly strong type of dire rat to assist in pulling their wagons and serving as mounts for caravan scouts. As rodents, riding rats respond favorably to ratfolk's commands, and the animals' hardiness and omnivorous diet make them very easy to care for even on long journeys through inhospitable terrain. Use the statistics for a dire rat with the giant simple template. A ratfolk with the animal companion, mount, or similar class feature can select a riding rat as her mount.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#riding_rat_companions`:

Riding Rat Companions
======================

\ **Starting Statistics**\ : \ **Size**\  Medium; \ **Speed**\  40 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; \ **AC**\  +1 natural armor; \ **Attack**\  bite (1d6); \ **Ability Scores**\  Str 14, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 4; \ **Special Qualities**\  low-light vision, scent.

\ **4th-Level Advancement**\ : \ **AC**\  +2 natural armor; \ **Ability Scores**\  Str +2, Dex +2; \ **Bonus Feat**\  :ref:`Endurance <corerulebook.feats#endurance>`\ .

Ratfolk Magic Items
********************

Ratfolk item crafters often make magic weapons with the following weapon special abilities.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#catalytic_weapon_special_ability`: `monstercodex.ratfolk#catalytic`_

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#catalytic`:

Catalytic
==========

\ **Price**\  +1 bonus; \ **Aura**\  strong evocation; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  —

This ability can be placed only on a :ref:`corrosive <advancedplayersguide.magicitems.weapons#corrosive>`\  or :ref:`corrosive burst <advancedplayersguide.magicitems.weapons#corrosive_burst>`\  weapon. When the wielder of a \ *catalytic*\  weapon hits a creature, the weapon triggers a devastating chemical reaction that burns the struck creature. The creature struck must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or take 1d6 points of acid damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. Successive hits with the \ *catalytic*\  weapon increase the duration but don't add to the damage. The creature can attempt to neutralize the reaction as a full-round action as if it were on fire (including bonuses for dropping and rolling on the ground or jumping into water). Anyone who hits a creature subject to this chemical reaction with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of acid damage.

.. _`monstercodex.ratfolk#construction_requirements`:

Construction Requirements

Virulent
=========

\ **Price**\  +1 bonus; \ **Aura**\  faint necromancy; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  —

A \ *virulent*\  weapon magically intensifies any poison it delivers. The saving throw DC of any poison applied to either a \ *virulent*\  weapon or any ammunition fired from it increases by a number equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus. The duration of the poison increases by a number of rounds equal to the \ *virulent*\  weapon's enhancement bonus.

Tactics
========

\ **Before Combat**\  The ratfolk sage casts :ref:`mage armor <corerulebook.spells.magearmor#mage_armor>`\  on himself each morning. Because he avoids entering direct combat, if battle is imminent, the ratfolk sage casts :ref:`spider climb <corerulebook.spells.spiderclimb#spider_climb>`\  on himself and climbs to a defensible position. If he is with several allies, he uses his wand of :ref:`blur <corerulebook.spells.blur#blur>`\  and scrolls of :ref:`magic weapon <corerulebook.spells.magicweapon#magic_weapon>`\  on them and their weapons before he does so.

\ **During Combat**\  The ratfolk sage casts :ref:`wall of fire <corerulebook.spells.walloffire#wall_of_fire>`\  to divide up the battlefield and trap the ratfolk's enemies. He then casts offensive spells until he runs out, at which point he uses a scroll of :ref:`magic weapon <corerulebook.spells.magicweapon#magic_weapon>`\  on his light crossbow before making attacks. If cornered, the sage uses :ref:`dimension door <corerulebook.spells.dimensiondoor#dimension_door>`\  to free himself.

Ratfolk Elder
==============

Since ratfolk have short lifespans, they heed the wisdom of those who attain old age. Many ratfolk aspire to become elders from a very young age, and try to get their hands on books and histories when they go into trade, intending to later study them. Often, aspiring leaders pursue the healing arts to keep the rest of the warren healthy—and to ensure they live long enough to pass on their knowledge.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Expel Pathogens (Ex)**\  When a kirrix hits with its bite attack, it can infect its target using its harbor pathogens ability (if any) with one disease it has stored, even if that disease can't normally be contracted via an injury. It can do this a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier. Alternatively, a kirrix can expend two uses of this ability to spray a disease in a 15-foot cone, exposing all creatures in the cone to the disease even if it can't normally be contracted by contact. Doing so depletes the kirrix's reserve of that disease.

\ **Harbor Pathogens (Ex)**\  A kirrix's body has innate features that let it clean up and contain diseases within ratfolk warrens. A kirrix collects diseases by consuming them off of objects or from the air (typically contact, ingested, or inhaled diseases), by ministering to a diseased creature (typically ingested or injury diseases), or by fighting a creature that imparts diseases and being subjected to one. The kirrix can store up to two types of diseases at a time in an organ near its throat. (A typical kirrix has filth fever and bubonic plague stored.) A kirrix can harmlessly digest an unwanted disease as a full-round action. If the creature consumes a mold or another substance that causes disease, it clears the surface of disease. If it ingests a diseased creature's blood (either by licking an open wound or biting the creature), it can produce an antiplague secretion, which it can use on itself or apply to others. Treat this as though the kirrix were using the :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  skill to treat disease with a +12 bonus.

Ratfolk have just as much enthusiasm for alchemy as they do for rodents, and they combined these two interests to create the kirrix—the result of generations of riding rat husbandry combined with regular infusions. These alchemical modifications have given kirrixes six legs and the ability to consume and transmit diseases without ill effect to the creatures themselves.

Many ratfolk settlements raise these gregarious creatures, with whom the ratfolk share their warrens in a symbiotic relationship. The kirrixes prowl the ratfolk tunnels and act as scavengers—searching for unfamiliar scents, consuming detritus, and removing harmful diseases from the ratfolk settlement. If the warren comes under attack, the kirrixes act as guards, and squeeze through or block tunnels as necessary to buy time for their ratfolk allies to escape.

A typical adult kirrix is 9 feet long and usually weighs under 500 pounds.
