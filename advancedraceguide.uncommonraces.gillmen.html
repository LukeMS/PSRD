<p>Gillmen are the remnants of a race of surface-dwelling humanoids whose homeland was drowned in a great cataclysm at the hands of the aboleth. The aboleths rescued a few survivors, warping them into an amphibious race to serve as emissaries to the surface world. Modern gillmen remain reclusive and suspicious, scarred by both the loss of their ancient heritage and the sure knowledge that aboleths do nothing without expecting to profit from it. Physically gillmen have expressive brows, pale skin, dark hair, and bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each side of their necks, near the shoulder, but they are otherwise close enough in appearance to humans that they can pass as such (for a time) without fear of detection.</p>

<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-2-constitution-2-charisma-2-wisdom"><strong>+2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, –2 Wisdom</strong>: Gillmen are vigorous and beautiful, but their domination by the aboleths has made them weak-willed.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-medium"><strong>Medium</strong>: Gillmen are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-aquatic"><strong>Aquatic</strong>: Gillmen are humanoids with the aquatic subtype.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-normal-speed"><strong>Normal Speed</strong>: Gillmen have a base speed of 30 feet on land. As aquatic creatures, they also have a swim speed of 30 feet, can move in water without making <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.swim.html#corerulebook-skills-swim-swim"><span class="std std-ref">Swim</span></a> checks, and always treat <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.swim.html#corerulebook-skills-swim-swim"><span class="std std-ref">Swim</span></a> as a class skill.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-amphibious"><strong>Amphibious</strong>: Gillmen have the aquatic subtype, but can breathe both water and air.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-enchantment-resistance"><strong>Enchantment Resistance</strong>: Gillmen gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against non-aboleth enchantment spells and effects, but take a –2 penalty on such saving throws against aboleth sources.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-water-dependent"><strong>Water Dependent</strong>: A gillman’s body requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water. Gillmen who spend more than 1 day without fully submerging themselves in water risk internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death within 4d6 hours.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-languages"><strong>Languages</strong>: Gillmen begin play speaking Common and Aboleth. Gillmen with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Aquan, Draconic, and Elven.</p>

<p>The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing gillman racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-riverfolk"><strong>Riverfolk</strong>: Some gillmen groups live in colonies along vast riverways, and have adapted to living on land for much longer periods. Gillmen with this trait have a thin coating of natural oil that keeps their skin from cracking even without water. However, this natural oil also makes such gillmen particularly susceptible to flames, and they gain vulnerability to fire. This racial trait replaces water dependent.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-slimehunter"><strong>Slimehunter</strong>: Gillmen with this trait are from lineages that have fought against aboleths since the aberrations rescued their human ancestors. They receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against aboleth spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. This racial trait replaces enchantment resistance.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-throwback"><strong>Throwback</strong>: Some gillmen are throwbacks to their land-dwelling human ancestors. Gillmen with this racial trait do not have the amphibious trait, have the human subtype instead of the aquatic subtype, have no swim speed or bonuses to the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.swim.html#corerulebook-skills-swim-swim"><span class="std std-ref">Swim</span></a> skill, cannot breathe water, and do not have the water dependent racial trait.</p>

This ability replaces the rogue talent rogues gained at 2nd level.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-eldritch-intuition"><strong>Eldritch Intuition (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an eldritch raider gains an intuitive sense that allows her to more easily activate sorcerer and wizard spell completion and spell trigger items.

<p id="advancedraceguide-uncommonraces-gillmen-sea-knife"><strong>Sea-Knife</strong>: A sea-knife is a long-handled weapon with a short blade. It is designed to be strapped to the ankle or foot of the wielder, pointing downward and jutting out beyond the wearer’s leg. Donning or removing a sea-knife is a full-round action. The wearer cannot use a leg with a sea-knife strapped to it for walking or running. A sea-knife can be used as a light melee weapon when the wielder is swimming, flying, or prone. This allows the wielder to use a two-handed weapon, or wield a weapon with one hand and carry a shield, and still make off-hand attacks with the sea-knife. Attacks made with a sea-knife take a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls in addition to all other attack penalties.</p>
