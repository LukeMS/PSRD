<p id="corerulebook-skills-heal-first-aid"><em>First Aid</em>: You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see <span class="xref std std-ref">Conditions</span> for rules on bleed damage).</p>
<p id="corerulebook-skills-heal-long-term-care"><em>Long-Term Care</em>: Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p>
<p>You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>
<p><em>Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones</em>: A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>
<p>A creature wounded by a <em>spike growth</em> or <em>spike stones</em> spell must succeed on a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.combat.html#corerulebook-combat-reflex"><span class="std std-ref">Reflex</span></a> save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-skills-heal-treat-deadly-wounds"><em>Treat Deadly Wounds</em>: When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#wisdom (wis)"><span class="std std-ref">Wisdom</span></a> modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a healer’s kit to perform this task. You take a –2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer’s kit that you lack.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-skills-heal-treat-poison"><em>Treat Poison</em>: To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-skills-heal-treat-disease"><em>Treat Disease</em>: To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a <em>spike growth</em> or <em>spike stones</em> spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again</strong>: Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: A character with the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-self-sufficient"><span class="std std-ref">Self-Sufficient</span></a> feat gets a bonus on Heal checks (see <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats"><span class="std std-ref">Feats</span></a>).</p>
<p>A healer’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p>
