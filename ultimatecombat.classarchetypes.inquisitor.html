<p>Some inquisitors believe that arcane magic is the enemy of faith. Though most of these inquisitors realize that arcane magic is a power that can never be truly stopped, they focus their abilities toward disrupting and destroying arcane practitioners who threaten the faith.</p>

<p>Some inquisitor domains are not the domains of their faith but are movements within a number of faiths. Many religious individuals and orders find themselves in conflict with the users of arcane magic, and have created inquisitions and training regimens expressly to fight arcane spellcasters. With GM approval, any inquisitor of any deity can take the inquisitions detailed below.</p>
<p>Inquisitions are like domains. Other classes that use domains can take inquisitions but inquisitions are typically weaker than the domains those classes can already choose because they don’t grant domain spell slots or domain spells. If an inquisition’s granted power calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor’s level + the inquisitor’s Wisdom modifier. The inquistor’s caster level for granted powers and spell-like abilities is equal to her inquisitor level.</p>

<p><em>Granted Powers</em>: You gain the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#disruptive (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Disruptive</span></a> feat as a bonus feat (even if you do not meet the prerequisites). When you defeat an enemy (whether by reducing it to 0 or fewer hit points, taking the enemy captive, or accepting a truce), you gain a +2 sacred or profane bonus to AC for 1 minute per level. You gain a sacred bonus if you are good, profane if you are evil; if you are neutral, you choose either sacred or profane when you select this inquisition. After you choose which type of bonus you gain, you cannot change the bonus type. When you hit a creature with levels of alchemist or any arcane spellcasting class, or that uses spell-like abilities, you can end this effect to stagger that creature. The creature gets a Fortitude saving throw against this effect on each of its turns (including the turn in which it gained the effect). A successful save ends the staggered condition.</p>

<p>Some magic items are heretical by nature, enabling the unfaithful to spread wickedness. Iconoclasts seek out and remove such crutches, cleansing the taint these items exude.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-shake-effects"><strong>Shake Effects (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, an iconoclast gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against effects that come from a magic item. This ability replaces monster lore.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-detect-magic"><strong>Detect Magic (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, an iconoclast gains the ability to <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.detectmagic.html#corerulebook-spells-detectmagic-detect-magic"><span class="std std-ref">detect magic</span></a> at will. This ability replaces <em>detect alignment</em>.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-dispelling-attack"><strong>Dispelling Attack (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, once per day as a standard action, an iconoclast can make a melee or ranged attack against an opponent, and if she hits, she can affect that opponent as if she had cast <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic.html#corerulebook-spells-dispelmagic-dispel-magic"><span class="std std-ref">dispel magic</span></a>, using the targeted dispel option. If she misses, this ability is wasted. Use her inquisitor level as the caster level of the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic.html#corerulebook-spells-dispelmagic-dispel-magic"><span class="std std-ref">dispel magic</span></a> effect. This ability replaces <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.discernlies.html#corerulebook-spells-discernlies-discern-lies"><span class="std std-ref">discern lies</span></a>.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-negating-critical"><strong>Negating Critical (Sp)</strong>: At 14th level, when an iconoclast confirms a critical hit, the creature she hit must succeed at a Fortitude save at DC 10 + 1/2 the iconoclast’s caster level + the iconoclast’s Wisdom modifier for each non-artifact magic item the target is wearing or carrying. On a failed saving throw, the target of the critical hit can neither use nor gain benefit from any minor magic item for 1d4 rounds. This ability can be used in conjunction with critical feats. This ability replaces exploit weakness.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-destroy-artifact"><strong>Destroy Artifact (Sp)</strong>: At 20th level, an iconoclast has the ability to destroy minor artifacts. The iconoclast must have possession of the minor artifact for at least a week, which she must spend in uninterrupted contemplation of the nature of the artifact. At the end of that week, she makes a DC 30 <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a> check to unweave the fabric of the item, and if she is successful, the artifact is destroyed. If the iconoclast fails, she cannot try to destroy the artifact again with this ability, but another iconoclast can. This ability replaces true judgment.</p>

<p>The world is full of dangerous magic, and many recoil in the face of such power. The spellbreaker, by contrast, learns to recognize and resist certain types of magic, wading through waves of magic to reach her foes.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-strong-willed"><strong>Strong-Willed (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a spellbreaker is able to stand strong against magical effects that seek to control, compel, or persuade her. The spellbreaker rolls twice and takes the best result when making a Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect. This ability replaces monster lore.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-defense-against-magic"><strong>Defense against Magic (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a spellbreaker picks a single wizard school. She gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against arcane spells of that school. Every four levels beyond 3rd, the spellbreaker picks a new school and gains this bonus against arcane spells of that school (to a maximum of five schools of magic at 19th level). Furthermore, each time the spellbreaker picks a new school, the bonuses for the schools she has already chosen increase by 1. This ability replaces all bonus teamwork feats.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-foil-casting"><strong>Foil Casting (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, when an opponent tries to cast an arcane spell within a spellbreaker’s threatened area, the DC for that caster to cast defensively increases by 2. This increase stacks with the effects of the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#disruptive (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Disruptive</span></a> feat. Furthermore, the spellbreaker knows where to hit foes to foil casting from a distance. Each time she hits an arcane spellcaster or a creature that uses spell-like abilities with a ranged weapon attack, the DC of any Concentration checks the caster makes increases by 2 for 1 round. This ability replaces solo tactics.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-impervious"><strong>Impervious (Ex)</strong>: At 20th level, a spellbreaker becomes immune to the effects of a single school of arcane magic. That school of magic must be the first one she picked for defense against magic (see above). Neither harmful nor helpful arcane spells of that school have an effect on the spellbreaker. If a spell of that school is an area of effect spell, the spell goes off as normal, but the spellbreaker is untouched by its effects. Once per day, as a swift action, the spellbreaker can grant this imperviousness to all allies in a 60-foot burst for 1 minute. This ability replaces final judgment.</p>

<div class="section" id="witch-hunter-archetype">

<p>When pursuing justice for their faith, inquisitors sometimes hunt sorcerers, witches, wizards, and other practitioners of arcane magic—but especially witches, since their devotion to a patron is often seen as suspect by many religions.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-spell-sage"><strong>Spell Sage (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a witch hunter adds her Wisdom modifier on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a> checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier when attempting to identify a spell as it is being cast, to identify the properties of a magic item using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.detectmagic.html#corerulebook-spells-detectmagic-detect-magic"><span class="std std-ref">detect magic</span></a>, or to decipher a scroll. This ability replaces monster lore.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-knowledgeable-defense"><strong>Knowledgeable Defense</strong>: At 2nd level, a witch hunter who identifies a spell with <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a> gains a bonus against its effects, either a +1 bonus on saving throws or a +1 dodge bonus to AC against this spell. This bonus increases every four levels (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). At 20th level, once per day as a swift action, she can grant this bonus to all her allies within 60 feet, for 1 minute. The allies gain the bonus when the witch hunter identifies the spell, and those among the allies who have at least 1 rank in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a> can aid the witch hunter’s next <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a> check as a swift action while under the effect of this ability. This ability replaces <em>detect alignment</em>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.discernlies.html#corerulebook-spells-discernlies-discern-lies"><span class="std std-ref">discern lies</span></a>, and true judgment.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-spell-scent"><strong>Spell Scent</strong>: At 6th level, the witch hunter learns how to sense unique spell signatures, and can follow the trail of a cast spell or spell effect cast back to its source. Once per day, when the witch hunter comes into contact with or is exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, she can spend a full-round action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gains the effect of a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.locatecreature.html#corerulebook-spells-locatecreature-locate-creature"><span class="std std-ref">locate creature</span></a> spell. She can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start her examination within 1 round after she experienced the spell’s effect. Instead of locating a known creature, the witch hunter locates the caster of the spell effect or magic item she examined. Doing so does not allow the witch hunter to gain any intelligence about the spellcaster other than its location. This ability replaces track.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-witchs-bane-judgment"><strong>Witch’s Bane Judgment (Ex)</strong>: At 14th level, a witch hunter gains the following judgment.</p>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-inquisitor-witchs-bane">
<div><em>Witch’s Bane</em>: Any creature that casts an arcane spell within 30 feet of the witch hunter takes a –2 penalty to AC against her attacks and a –2 penalty on saving throws against her spells while this judgment remains in effect. This ability replaces exploit weakness.</div></blockquote>
