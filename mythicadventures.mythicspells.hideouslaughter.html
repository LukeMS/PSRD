<p>A creature of a type different than your own doesn’t gain a bonus on its saving throws against this spell. The affected target laughs so hard it hurts, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round it spends laughing.</p>
<p>If the target fails its initial save, it must succeed at two follow-up saving throws (each a full-round action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity) to end the spell. Succeeding at only one save means the spell no longer deals damage, but the target is still unable to take actions.</p>
<p><strong>Augmented</strong>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target’s laughter becomes contagious. When the target’s allies are within 30 feet and can hear the laugh, they must successfully save against the spell or be sickened until the target stops laughing. The sickened effect ends if the ally moves more than 30 feet from the target or is unable to hear the target’s laughter for an entire round.</p>
