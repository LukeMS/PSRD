<p>It’s possible for a barbarian to have trace amounts of a bloodline; such barbarians can be trained or might seek spiritual guidance to unlock these powers to terrifying effect.</p>

<p>Any barbarian meeting the prerequisites can take the following new rage powers. Blood rage powers grant powers in a theme, similar to how a bloodrager’s bloodline powers work. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of blood rage powers. A barbarian of any level can take a lesser blood rage power. The middle blood rage power (the one without “lesser” or “greater” in the title) can be taken only by a barbarian of 6th level or higher who already has the lesser blood rage power of its group. A greater blood rage power can be taken only by a barbarian of 10th level or higher who already has the middle blood rage power.</p>
