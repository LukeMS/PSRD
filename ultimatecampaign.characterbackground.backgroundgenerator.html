<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-backgroundgenerator-background-generator"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id60">Background Generator</a><a class="headerlink" href="#background-generator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The background generator is intended to remove the creative pressure that can sometimes frustrate players as they try to flesh out the murky details of their characters’ backgrounds. This generator provides these details with either a simple roll of the die or the players deliberately selecting from options on the furnished tables and lists. Think of each element on the background generator’s tables as a piece of story material that you can link together with other random pieces to create a story you otherwise might now have imagined. Use this tool to inspire creativity rather than as hard-and-fast rules to mandate rigid and seamless character backgrounds. Though the generator provides many foundational details of a character’s background, it takes some creative thought to massage the specifics together. As you use the generator, feel free at any point to reject or reroll contradictory elements or ones that go against your vision of the emerging character. Like the background questions presented earlier in this chapter, the ideas on these tables are simply suggestions designed to channel and focus your imagination.</p>
<p>To generate a background, you roll on a number of tables and subtables, but before you do this, you must decide the gender, race, and class of your PC. Such decisions will help to inform the tables you’ll use. After you’ve determined these basic character elements, you can begin using the background generator to determine your character’s unique background by following the three steps summarized below, which are detailed further in the pages that follow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1—Homeland, Family, and Childhood</strong>: Determine the circumstances of your birth, your parents’ profession, and a major childhood event. To determine the number of siblings you have, roll on the table appropriate for your race. For each sibling you have, roll d%; 01—50: the sibling is female, 51—100: the sibling is male. Then roll on the <a class="reference internal" href="#ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-backgroundgenerator-table-relative-age-of-sibling"><span class="std std-ref">Relative Age of Sibling table</span></a> to determine the relative age of the sibling.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2—Adolescence and Training</strong>: Determine the circumstances and events that defined your adolescence and the training you received, as well as create an influential associate from this time in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3—Moral Conflict, Relationships, and Vulnerabilities</strong>: Determine a major conflict in your past, the other party involved, and how you resolved the conflict. Also determine your romantic relationships, relationships with fellow adventurers, and personality drawbacks.</p>
<p>While rolling on the tables in these three steps, you are sometimes granted access to a trait, story feat, or drawback. Upon gaining access to one of these rules elements, write it down. At the end of background generation, you can choose up to two of the traits you’ve gained access to. If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection). When you gain access to a story feat, it means you’ve met the prerequisite for the feat and can take it at any time, not just at character creation.</p>

<p>The tables below determine the basics of your family and homeland. These establish the circumstances of your upbringing, the composition of your family, and your family’s social standing, as well as a major event you experienced in childhood. To determine these aspects of your background, do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<tr class="row-odd"><td>51—60</td>
<td><strong>Hatred of Civilization</strong>: When you first encountered civilization in your youth, its weak and decadent people revolted you.

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>61—70</td>
<td><strong>Persecution</strong>: You grew up under the persecution of another power—perhaps a rival tribe, an expansionistic empire, or a tribe of violent monsters. Beaten and bloodied, your people barely survived the onslaught. But the beatings made you strong and taught you how to channel the pain into something useful. Since that time, the flame of rage has burned inside you, waiting to be released against your oppressors. You gain access to the Bullied combat trait.</td>

In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your rage stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind.

You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that’s how you like it.

Either linked to powerful scions of mystical power like angels, devils, or dragons or touched by the forces of destiny themselves, sorcerers prove that sometimes when magic is involved, either you have it or you don’t.

What slumbered in your blood has never quieted, and you frequently draw upon the inspiration of your awakening. You gain access to the Ascendant Recollection magic trait.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>21—30</td>
<td><strong>Failed Wizard</strong>: Although your arcane aptitude was evident at an early age, you were pushed toward wizardry as the conduit for your magic.

<p>Most, if not all, spellcasters can call to otherworldly creatures for aid. And though many learn to call increasingly powerful minions to assist them, none boast the same connection to these outsiders as summoners do. A summoner is defined by the bond formed with the single creature that acts as his eidolon. Protectors, steeds, and links to other worlds, eidolons are lifelong companions for their mortal masters. The choice to tie oneself to an eidolon and the circumstances leading to that choice form the foundation of any summoner’s character.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>11—20</td>
<td><strong>Caretaker</strong>: You met your eidolon or another outsider in a moment of danger. Wounded or lost, the creature crashed between worlds and ended up at your feet. In helping this panicked, otherworldly creature, you felt a link to it. You can still draw on the inspiration from that moment when dealing with others, outsider or not. You gain access to the Destined Diplomat social trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>21—30</td>
<td><strong>Forced to Confront Your Own Limits</strong>: The bond with your eidolon first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help. Your feeling of desperation and frustration at the limits of your own form attracted your eidolon—whether or not it was able to help you in that moment. This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your eidolon. You gain access to the Desperate Speed magic trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>31—40</td>
<td><strong>Imaginary Friends</strong>: As a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you. These whispers were actually the wandering thoughts of outsiders trying to make contact, knowing that someday you would have an affinity with their kind. By the time you learned to summon your eidolon and other outsiders, these whispered fragments had turned themselves into an understanding of the language of outsiders. You gain access to the Unintentional Linguist social trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>41—50</td>
<td><strong>Monophobic</strong>: You were always terrified of being alone when you were younger, so you surrounded yourself with others. But it was establishing this link to your eidolon that ultimately allowed you to overcome this debilitating fear. Now, even when your eidolon is not with you, you know it’s never far away; conversely, when you have your true friend and companion with you, you are far better for it. You gain access to the Perpetual Companion faith trait.</td>
</tr>

<td><strong>Outsider’s Lineage</strong>: You have the blood of outsiders in your veins. This lineage either laid dormant until your powers manifested or was a storied part of your family heritage. Regardless, your connection to the planes has always been potent. No matter what other subjects you studied, your understanding of planar matters has always seemed instinctive or innate rather than the product of memorization and study. You gain access to the Planar Savant faith trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>61—70</td>
<td><strong>Pick On Someone Your Own Size</strong>: When you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were. You later realized that this support was the first trace of your eidolon trying to make contact with you. You can still draw on that power today, making your aura strong and your presence powerful. You gain access to the Twinned Presence magic trait.</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td>71—80</td>
<td><strong>Raising Gone Wrong</strong>: You lost someone important to you. Through means, luck, or simple pity, you had the chance to raise that person from the dead, but something went wrong with the spell and the raising did not occurâ¦ at least not as planned. Your lost friend or kin’s soul bonded with a powerful outsider on the other side of the veil and returned to you as your eidolon. Possessed of some of the memories and experiences of the life you spent together, your companion feels a stronger devotion than even most others of its kind. You gain access to the Loyalty across Lifetimes faith trait.</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>81—90</td>
<td><strong>Saved by Another</strong>: Someone or something saved you from great danger. It might have been a family member who saved you from a precipitous fall or adventurers who saved you from a marauding monster. Your sense of gratitude fostered a strong sense of protectiveness, particularly when defending your allies or your eidolon. You gain access to the Dedicated Defender combat trait.</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td>91—100</td>
<td><strong>Stranger in Your Own Skin</strong>: You have felt awkward and uncomfortable your entire life, as if you were born into a body that wasn’t truly yours. Your quest to become what you’ve always felt you should be led you to your eidolon, in which you found what you see as your own idealized form. The link that you and your eidolon share allows you to escape some of the inherent limits of your form from time to time. You gain access to the Linked Surge magic trait.</td>

This could have been a military commander, tribal chieftain, guild leader, or gang leader. From the boss, you learned how to make people listen, make them see reason, and keep them in line. You gain access to the Natural-Born Leader social trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>51—55</td>
<td><strong>The Academic</strong>: One of your associates had such a lust for knowledge that she could never be satisfied with simple answers or obvious solutions. This desire for knowledge frequently exceeded her need for companionship, but you were the single exception. Through this association you developed a keen appreciation for numbers, geometry, logic, hard study, and problem solving. You gain access to the Mathematical <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats.html#ultimatemagic-ultimatemagicfeats-prodigy"><span class="std std-ref">Prodigy</span></a> magic trait.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>61—65</td>
<td><strong>The Seer</strong>: You were close to a person who claimed to see the future—perhaps an oracle, seer, prophet, or merely some festival charlatan. Whether they’re true or a trick, you’ve seen visions of distant places and of times that may come to pass. The seer’s influence either made you into an optimist with a drive to change the future or a fatalist resigned to accept it. You gain access to the Scholar of the Great Beyond faith trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>66—70</td>
<td><strong>The Mystic</strong>: You were especially close to a holy person in your community who fundamentally changed your life by opening your eyes to the incredible powers that exist beyond the natural world.

You gain access to the Child of the Temple faith trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>71—75</td>
<td><strong>The Dead One</strong>: One of your greatest influences was a sentient undead creature, such as a ghost, lich, grave knight, wraith, or vampire. You encountered it on several occasions and survivedâ¦ mostly unscathed. Through this strange relationship you learned of its mortal life, giving you perspective on your own life. You gain access to the Deathtouched bloodline race trait and the Glimpse Beyond story feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>76—80</td>
<td><strong>The Fiend</strong>: In your adolescent years, you dealt with or were possessed by a fiend who lent you raw power at a time of great need. This experience tainted your body and mind and changed your life. Some part of the demon remains inside you like an old friend, influencing you toward destructive ends. You gain access to the Possessed magic trait and the Damned story feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>81—85</td>
<td><strong>The Wanderer</strong>: You knew someone who traveled from place to place with the changing of the wind, such as a minstrel, convict, merchant, outcast, soldier, or sailor.

You gain access to the Worldly social trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>86—90</td>
<td><strong>The Champion</strong>: You were close to someone who excelled at athletic endeavors and tests of strength or skill. Through your friendship or rivalry, you developed the competitive spirit that continues to drive you in everything you do. You gain access to the Ambitious social trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>91—95</td>
<td><strong>The Craftsperson</strong>: One of your major influences cherished perfection in every form of art. This person might have followed any path in life, from craftsperson to artist to assassin.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>96—100</td>
<td><strong>Well-Connected Friend</strong>: In your circle of disparate associates, there was someone everyone knew. This person collected friends like trophies, and she had contacts in every social or professional circle.

You gain access to the Well-Informed halfling race trait (which you may take regardless of your race).</td>

<p>With age come the events and relationships that leave a definitive mark on your personality. You face and resolve moral challenges, your romantic relationships blossom and sometimes wilt, you meet those who become adventuring companions, and you face your vulnerabilities either in the form of personal challenges or adversaries who represent some side of yourself.</p>
<p>To determine a major conflict you had in the past, as well as your romantic relationships and personality drawbacks, do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Roll on the tables below to determine a major conflict you had, whom you had the conflict with, the motivation for the conflict, and how you resolved it. Then adjust your alignment using the alignment track.</li>
<li>Choose the deity or religious philosophy you follow, which grants access to a trait.</li>
<li>Roll on the <span class="xref std std-ref">Romantic Relationships table</span> to determine what your romantic relationships have been like.</li>
<li>Roll on the <span class="xref std std-ref">Relationship with a Fellow Adventurer table</span>, likely multiple times, to determine the various relationships with your fellow adventurers.</li>
<li>Roll on the <span class="xref std std-ref">Character Drawback table</span> to determine your character’s drawbacks. You can take this drawback to gain another trait.</li>

<p>The following tables provide a means of determining your alignment by introducing a pivotal moral conflict in your early life—one moment during your ethical development that determined the kind of person you grew up to be.</p>
<p>When determining your conflict, you accumulate a number of Conflict Points (CP). The conflict and your motivation are each worth a number of CP; you can adjust the number of CP based on the resolution of the conflict. When you determine the total CP, you then must add your CP on one alignment track or distribute the points on both of them—the good-evil track and the lawful-chaotic track, as detailed on the <span class="xref std std-ref">Determining Alignment table</span>. Position 1 on the track represents the first CP added. Each point on the first track represents you turning away from what is good and heading down a path of evil. Each point on the second track represents a disregard for law as you grow more chaotic. This determines how the conflict ultimately affected your alignment and to what extent. If you are using the rules for changing your alignment, this also determines your starting place on the alignment track. If you start with 0 CP on either track, assume you start at 1 on the track for those rules.</p>

<p>Once you determine the nature and CP for the event, the next step is to determine the resolution. Instead of rolling for the conflict’s resolution, you choose how you dealt with it, and your choice can affect the number of CP the conflict is worth. In games that do not allow evil characters, you cannot take a resolution that would adjust your character to an evil alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Regret and Penance (—3 CP)</strong>: Not only do you regret your action, but you have publicly admitted to it and did your best to make amends for the wrongdoing. Most know of the conflict’s details and those who don’t can easily find them out if they know where to look or whom to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Sincere Regret (—2 CP)</strong>: Though you feel sincere regret for the event and its memory affects your behavior, it’s still a secret. Only your trusted companions know of the conflict, and they have promised a degree of discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Regret (—1 CP)</strong>: You regret the conflict, but go to great lengths to keep it secret and try desperately to forget it ever happened. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement in the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Feelings (0 CP)</strong>: Sometimes you regret the conflict, but other times you feel as if you didn’t have a choice in the matter or that you made the right decision. Most of the time, you just avoid thinking about the conflict. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Denial (+1 CP)</strong>: You feel little if any regret, and deny the event mostly so others won’t judge you. Few if any know of your part in the conflict, and your constant denials are meant to keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>No Guilt (+2 CP)</strong>: Either guilt is for the weak, or you know you made the right decision. You might not openly brag about your part in the conflict, but you don’t deny it when confronted either.</p>
<p><strong>You Enjoyed It (+3 CP)</strong>: Those who cling to petty morals have no understanding of what true freedom and power is. The fact is, you enjoyed your part in the conflict and would do it all over again if the opportunity presented itself. Many people know of your misdeed, and they also realize your complete lack of remorse.</p>

<p>This table is best used by the adventuring party as a whole to determine starting relationships between the characters. One player begins the process by choosing someone in the group and rolling to learn the relationship between her and the second character. Then the next player chooses a different character and rolls to determine their relationship, and so on, until finally the last player rolls to determine his relationship with the first character. It is easiest to do this sitting around a table, with each player passing the dice clockwise until the dice have completed a full turn around the table.</p>
<p>You can also use this table free-form if you wish, rolling for your relationship for as many or as few of the other characters as you care to define; however, the first method guarantees that every character has connections to two other characters to improve group cohesion.</p>
<p>If you end up with a result that makes no sense or isn’t possible, reroll or just chose another option.</p>

<p>Character drawbacks are emotional weak points—chinks your armor. A drawback gives you a small mechanical penalty and a roleplaying hook. Drawbacks also serve as loopholes in the alignment system. When roleplaying your drawback, you might act well outside the bounds of your alignment within certain situations. Each of the following grants a drawback you may choose to take. If you take a drawback option, you may take three traits you have access to instead of two. Roll on the following table to determine your character’s drawback.</p>
<p>Discuss with the GM the details of this drawback, such as what the attachment is or who the person involved might be.</p>
