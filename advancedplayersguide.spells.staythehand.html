<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 immediate action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level and special; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You cause a creature’s arm to waver and prevent it from striking another creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both accuracy and power, taking a –5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally targeted for the duration of the spell.</p>
