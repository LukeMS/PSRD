<span id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-half-orcs"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Half-Orcs</a><a class="headerlink" href="#half-orcs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As seen by civilized races, half-orcs are monstrosities, the result of perversion and violence—whether or not this is actually true. Half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. Half-orcs as a whole resent this treatment, and rather than play the part of the victim, they tend to lash out, unknowingly confirming the biases of those around them. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon half-orcs manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom—though sometimes it’s easier just to crack a few skulls. Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded orcs that they are just as fierce. Others opt for trying to blend into human society, constantly demonstrating that they aren’t monsters. Their need to always prove themselves worthy encourages half-orcs to strive for power and greatness within the society around them.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>: Half-orcs average around 6 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these “tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, half-orcs are as varied as their human parents.</p>
<p><strong>Society</strong>: Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society’s discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by humans who don’t bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods. Even on the best of terms, half-orcs in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, orc leaders have been known to deliberately spawn half-orcs, as the halfbreeds make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural leaders and strategic advisors.</p>
<p>Within orc tribes, half-orcs find themselves constantly striving to prove their worth in battle and with feats of strength. Half-orcs raised within orc tribes are more likely to file their tusks and cover themselves in tribal tattoos. Tribal leaders quietly recognize that half-orcs are often more clever than their orc cousins and often apprentice them to the tribe’s shaman, where their cunning might eventually strengthen the tribe. Apprenticeship to a shaman is a brutal and often short-lived distinction, however, and those half-orcs who survive it either become influential in the tribe or are eventually driven to leave.</p>
<p>Half-orcs have a much more mixed experience in human society, where many cultures view them as little more than monsters. They often are unable even to get normal work, and are pressed into service in the military or sold into slavery. In these cultures, half-orcs often lead furtive lives, hiding their nature whenever possible. The dark underworld of society is often the most welcoming place, and many half-orcs wind up serving as enforcers for thieves guilds or other types of organized crime.</p>
<p>Less commonly, human cities may allow half-orcs a more normal existence, even enabling them to develop small communities of their own. These communities are usually centered around the arena districts, the military, or mercenary organizations where their brute strength is valued and their appearance is more likely to be overlooked. Even surrounded by their own kind, half-orc life isn’t easy. Bullying and physical confrontation comes easy to a people who have been raised with few other examples of behavior. It is, however, one of the best places for young half-orcs to grow up without prejudice, and these small enclaves are one of the few places where half-orc marriages and children are truly accepted and sometimes cherished.</p>
<p>Even more rarely, certain human cultures come to embrace half-orcs for their strength. There are stories of places where people see half-orc children as a blessing and seek out half-orc or orc lovers. In these cultures, half-orcs lead lives not much different from full-blooded humans.</p>
<p><strong>Relations</strong>: Elves and dwarves tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a resemblance to their racial enemies, and other races aren’t much more understanding.</p>
<p>A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc wary and quick to anger, yet people who break through his savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. Human societies with few orc problems tend to be the most accommodating, and half-orcs dwelling there can often find work as mercenaries and enforcers. Even in places where there is a general tolerance for half-orcs, however, many humans mistreat them when they can get away with it.</p>
<p>Half-orcs are envious of the measure of acceptance half-elves have within human and elven society and resent their physical beauty, which contrasts starkly to the half-orcs’ brutish appearance. While half-orcs avoid antagonizing their half-breed cousins directly, they won’t hesitate to undermine them if the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>Of all the other races, half-orcs are most sympathetic with halflings, who often have an equally rough lot in life. Half-orcs respect the halfling’s ability to blend in and disappear and admire their perpetually cheerful outlook on life in spite of hardships. Halflings fail to appreciate this fact because they usually are too busy avoiding the large, intimidating half-orcs.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>: Forced to live either among brutish orcs or as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter, violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but they are not evil by nature—rather, most half-orcs are chaotic neutral, having been taught by long experience that there’s no point doing anything but that which directly benefits themselves. Half-orcs worship the human or orc gods venerated in the area where they were raised. Those who live alongside humans most often worship human gods of war, freedom, or destruction. Half-orcs raised in orc tribes find themselves most drawn to the gods of blood, fire, and iron—depending more on what god the tribe worships rather than the half-orcs’ personal preference. Many half-orcs are contrary about religion, either ignoring it entirely, or getting deeply involved in it and trying to find meaning in a life filled with hate and misunderstanding; even a half-orc divine spellcaster may wrestle with doubt and anger about religion and faith.</p>
<p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world.</p>
<p>Half-orcs raised in orc societies often take up the brutish ways of those around them, becoming fighters, barbarians, or rangers. Half-orcs who survive their shaman training may eventually succeed their masters as tribal shamans, or flee the tribe and practice their magic as outcasts or explorers.</p>
<p>Half-orcs are just as likely to have children that possess an innate talent for sorcery as any other race, with the abyssal, destined, and elemental fire bloodlines being the most common types of sorcerers. Half-orcs are fascinated by alchemy, and its destructive capabilities make its usefulness obvious in any orc tribe. Half-orc alchemists treat themselves as living experiments, even to the point of trying to separate their orc and human halves through alchemy. Other alchemists use their powers to enhance their physical abilities and thus increase their status within orc communities.</p>
<p>In human societies, half-orcs have a few more options. Many find it easy to take advantage of the brute strength and work as mercenaries or caravan guards. Crime is another easy route for half-orcs, as there are plenty of criminals looking for a strong arm. Half-orc clerics in human communities are fairly rare; the more religious half-orcs more often turn to (or get pushed to) the martial aspects of religious service and become paladins or inquisitors. Half-orcs usually lack the patience and money required to become a wizard.</p>

<span id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-racial-subtypes"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Racial Subtypes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#racial-subtypes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can combine various alternate racial traits to create half-orc subraces or variant races, such as the following.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-arena-bred"><strong>Arena-Bred</strong>: Many half-orcs are born and raised to fight in the arena, and in many cases have two half-orc parents or even a half-orc and a human parent. These arena-bred half-orcs lose the brutal physical appearance of their orc ancestors and look more human. They have the city-raised and skilled alternate racial traits.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-deep-kin"><strong>Deep Kin</strong>: Some half-orcs are descended from clans that remained in the eternal darkness below the surface. Half-orcs from these clans tend to be smaller and more at home underground than those descended from surface-dwelling orcs. These half-orcs have the acute darkvision and cavewight alternate racial traits.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-feral"><strong>Feral</strong>: Half-orc children who are abandoned as infants or small children rarely survive in the wild, but a few manage to scrape out a meager existence as “wild children,” tough enough to live but completely uncivilized. Feral half-orcs have the forest walker and toothy alternate racial traits.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-mountain-clan"><strong>Mountain Clan</strong>: Half-orcs from the more mountainous regions tend to be more agile and alert to the echoing sounds of their homeland. Mountain clan half-orcs have the bestial and rock climber racial traits.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-mystic"><strong>Mystic</strong>: Orc shamans are brutal teachers who sometimes kill or maim their most promising students in order to eliminate what could be a potential rival. Half-orcs who survive years of abuse by an orc shaman master are deeply scarred and altered by the experience. Shaman trainees learn early that cunning and luck are often the only things that offer a chance of survival. They have the shaman’s apprentice and sacred tattoo alternate racial traits.</p>

<span id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-blood-god-disciple-summoner"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Blood God Disciple (Summoner)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#blood-god-disciple-summoner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A half-orc summoner who devotes himself to one of the bloody orc gods may believe his eidolon is an avatar of that god rather than a mere supernatural creature. A blood god disciple generally fights by the avatar’s side and offers it blood sacrifices in exchange for martial prowess. A blood god disciple has the following class features.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-blood-feast"><strong>Blood Feast (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution’s effects use the summoner’s Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon’s. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has.</p>
<p>At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer.</p>
<p>This ability replaces the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-i"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster I</span></a>, <em>III</em>, <em>V</em>, <em>VII</em>, and <em>IX</em> spell-like abilities.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-bloody-gift"><strong>Bloody Gift (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-ii"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster II</span></a> spell-like ability.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-avatar-gambit"><strong>Avatar Gambit (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-iv"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster IV</span></a> spell-like ability.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-rage-power"><strong>Rage Power (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage). This replaces the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-vi"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster VI</span></a> and <em>VIII</em> spell-like abilities.</p>

<div class="section" id="hateful-rager-barbarian">
<span id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-hateful-rager-barbarian"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Hateful Rager (Barbarian)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#hateful-rager-barbarian" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From a young age, many half-orcs are treated cruelly, bullied, ridiculed, and made outcasts. While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers. A hateful rager has the following class features.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-reduced-rage"><strong>Reduced Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level and every level thereafter, a hateful rager only gains 1 additional round of rage per day instead of the normal 2 additional rounds of rage per day.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-favored-enemy"><strong>Favored Enemy (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a hateful rager selects a favored enemy. This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class.</p>
<p>While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route.</p>
<p>This ability replaces the barbarian’s rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-feed-the-rage"><strong>Feed the Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a hateful rager gains 1 additional round of rage for each favored enemy she knocks unconscious or kills in combat. These current rounds of rage can only be used to add to the duration of her rage, and disappear when the rage ends. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-amplified-by-hate"><strong>Amplified by Hate (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a hateful rager adds half her favored enemy bonus to the DC of any rage power she uses against a favored enemy. This ability replaces trap sense +3.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-rage-powers"><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the hateful rager archetype: intimidating glare, roused anger, terrifying howl; come and get me, inspire ferocity, overbearing advance, reckless abandon .</p>

<div class="section" id="redeemer-paladin">
<span id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-redeemer-paladin"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Redeemer (Paladin)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#redeemer-paladin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As most half-orcs are outcasts, a half-orc paladin recognizes that often those who are monstrous are not necessarily evil and that sometimes even those who are evil became that way because of circumstances and misfortune. Some half-orc paladins take up these misunderstood creatures as their cause, standing up for the monstrous creatures and, when possible, leading them to the light. These paladins are called redeemers. A redeemer has the following class features.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-merciful-smite"><strong>Merciful Smite (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, when a redeemer chooses to smite a creature, she can have all of her attacks against the target deal nonlethal damage. She does not take the normal –4 attack roll penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. She cannot use this ability to deal nonlethal damage to outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead creatures (these creatures take lethal damage from her smite). This otherwise works like and replaces the standard paladin’s smite evil.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-monstrous-rapport"><strong>Monstrous Rapport (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, redeemers gain a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.diplomacy.html#corerulebook-skills-diplomacy-diplomacy"><span class="std std-ref">Diplomacy</span></a> checks to influence creatures who are commonly considered monstrous. This includes but is not limited to “monstrous” races such as goblins and orcs, monstrous humanoids, and other intelligent non-humanoid monsters. This ability replaces <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.detectevil.html#corerulebook-spells-detectevil-detect-evil"><span class="std std-ref">detect evil</span></a>.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-pact-of-peace"><strong>Pact of Peace (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a redeemer can force a defeated creature to accept a binding pact of peace as a condition of its surrender, as if using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.geasquest.html#corerulebook-spells-geasquest-geas-lesser"><span class="std std-ref">lesser geas</span></a>. Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include “Leave this city and do not return” or “Do not attack caravans.” The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-aura-of-mercy"><strong>Aura of Mercy (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a redeemer can expend two uses of her merciful smite ability to grant the merciful smite ability to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this merciful smite ability by the start of the paladin’s next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability. This replaces aura of justice.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-associates"><strong>Associates</strong>: A redeemer may ally with an evil creature as long as she feels the creature is capable of redemption. A redeemer may accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are not lawful good provided they demonstrate they are willing to follow her and seek betterment under her tutelage.</p>

<p>Pushed into a life of crime by the society around them, half-orcs gravitate toward criminal activities that suit them best. Half-orc rogues leave subtle tactics and finesse to halflings and elves, and rely on brute strength and thuggery when they go about making mischief. Skulking slayers have turned the use of raw strength and surprise into an art form. A skulking slayer has the following class features.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-weapon-and-armor-proficiency"><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: The skulking slayer gains proficiency with greatclubs and whips, but loses proficiency with rapiers and hand crossbows.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-class-skills"><strong>Class Skills</strong>: The skulking slayer does not gain <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.disabledevice.html#corerulebook-skills-disabledevice-disable-device"><span class="std std-ref">Disable Device</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.linguistics.html#corerulebook-skills-linguistics-linguistics"><span class="std std-ref">Linguistics</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand.html#corerulebook-skills-sleightofhand-sleight-of-hand"><span class="std std-ref">Sleight of Hand</span></a> as class skills.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-skill-ranks-per-level"><strong>Skill Ranks per Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-pass-for-human"><strong>Pass for Human (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, when trying to conceal her half-orc heritage, a skulking slayer gains a bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.disguise.html#corerulebook-skills-disguise-disguise"><span class="std std-ref">Disguise</span></a> checks equal to half her level. When using disguise to appear as a specific individual, skulking stalkers ignore the normal –2 penalty to appear as another race.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-underhanded-maneuvers"><strong>Underhanded Maneuvers (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, when she could normally make a sneak attack, a slayer may instead make a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver with a bonus on her roll. This bonus is equal to her number of sneak attack dice for a dirty trick combat maneuver, or 1-1/2 × her number of sneak attack dice for a steal combat maneuver. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-bonus-feats"><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 2nd level, a skulking slayer can select the Surprise Follow-Through feat (see below) in place of a rogue talent. At 10th level, she can select the Improved Surprise Follow-Through feat (if she already has Surprise Follow-Through) in place of an advanced rogue talent.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-bold-strike"><strong>Bold Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, when a skulking slayer charges and makes a sneak attack with a two-handed weapon, she rolls d8s instead of d6s for her sneak attack damage. This ability replaces trap sense +1 and +4.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-shifty"><strong>Shifty (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a skulking slayer gains a bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.bluff.html#corerulebook-skills-bluff-bluff"><span class="std std-ref">Bluff</span></a> checks to feint equal to half her level. This ability replaces trap sense +2.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-unexpected-charge"><strong>Unexpected Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a skulking slayer can make a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.bluff.html#corerulebook-skills-bluff-bluff"><span class="std std-ref">Bluff</span></a> check to feint as a swift action before a charge. This ability replaces trap sense +3.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-rogue-talents"><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the skulking slayer archetype: combat trick, surprise attack; combat swipe, powerful sneak ; terrain mastery.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-advanced-talents"><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the skulking slayer archetype: crippling strike; deadly sneak ; unwitting ally.</p>

<p>Half-orcs have access to the following equipment.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-black-fester"><strong>Black Fester</strong>: This black paste is often applied on orc weapons before going on raids to stymie an enemy’s healing magic. Like a poison, black fester stays on a weapon until the first time it strikes an opponent. It remains in the target’s body for 1 hour. A creature exposed to black fester resists magical healing; a creature trying to magically heal the target must make a DC 10 caster level check to restore any hit points to the target.</p>
<p id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-half-orc-disguise-kit"><strong>Half-Orc Disguise Kit</strong>: This specifically designed kit was put together by half-orcs to help them appear more human. It includes skin cream to disguise green-gray skin color and other items designed to conceal or draw attention away from typical half-orc physical characteristics. Using this kit on a half-orc grants a +3 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.disguise.html#corerulebook-skills-disguise-disguise"><span class="std std-ref">Disguise</span></a> checks to appear human. Used on an orc, it only grants a +1 bonus on these checks. A half-orc disguise kit is exhausted after 10 uses.</p>

<div class="section" id="beast-rider">
<span id="advancedraceguide-coreraces-halforcs-beast-rider"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Beast Rider</a><a class="headerlink" href="#beast-rider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You gain the service of a monstrous companion or mount.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Animal companion or mount class feature, character level 7th, half-orc or orc.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Select one of the following creature types: elephant, pteranodon, rhinoceros, stegosaurus, or triceratops. Add this creature type to your list of possible animal companions or mounts. When summoning a creature of the selected type to serve as a mount or companion, treat your effective druid level as if it were two levels higher (to a maximum of your character level). If the creature is large enough for you to ride, it gains the combat training general purpose (see <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.handleanimal.html#corerulebook-skills-handleanimal-handle-animal"><span class="std std-ref">Handle Animal</span></a>) at no cost.</p>

<p>Seeing an ally fall in combat fills you with a raging and murderous fury.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Half-orc or orc, nonlawful.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever one of your allies is reduced to negative hit points or killed, you may enter a state similar to but less powerful than a barbarian’s rage as a free action on your next turn. If you have the rage class feature and are already raging, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by +2 for the duration of your rage. If you do not have the rage class feature, or you have no more rage rounds left, this weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian’s rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. In either case, this state lasts for 4 rounds.</p>
<p>As with a barbarian’s rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued; if another ally falls before this duration ends, the weaker rage lasts for an additional 4 rounds. This feat does not allow you to enter a rage if you are fatigued. You may only use this feat if the fallen ally had at least as many Hit Dice as you (excluding conjured or summoned allies).</p>

<p>Breaking things adds to your power.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are raging and you succeed at a sunder combat maneuver, you regain 1 round of rage. If the sunder attempt causes the object to gain the broken condition, you heal 1 hit point. You can only gain these benefits once per round.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 13, half-orc, orc ferocity racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain the ferocity universal monster ability, allowing you to continue fighting at negative hit points. When using this ability, you gain a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Normal</strong>: A half-orc with the orc ferocity racial trait can fight for 1 more round after he is brought below 0 hit points.</p>

<p>You spit in the face of death.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ferocity racial trait, half-orc or orc, rage class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day when raging, if you are hit by an attack that would deal enough hit points of damage to kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution score), as an immediate action you may expend 1 or more rounds of rage to negate some of this damage and keep yourself alive. Each round of rage you spend reduces the attack’s damage by 1 point, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit point.</p>
<p>For example, if you are raging, have a raging Constitution score of 18, are currently at 2 hit points, and take 20 hit points of damage from a hit (which is enough to bring you to –18 hit points, thereby killing you), you may spend 1 round of rage to reduce the damage by 1 hit point (leaving you perilously close to death at –17 hit points); if you spend 17 rounds of rage, you reduce the damage to 1 (the minimum), leaving you with 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If this damage still makes you fall unconscious, your rage ends just like it normally would, lowering your Constitution to its normal value and reducing your hit point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this feat to prevent yourself from instantly dying, yet you still die because your negative hit points exceed your normal Constitution score—take your normal Constitution into account when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend with this feat.</p>

<p>Horrible wounds, whether on yourself or your enemies, make your blood sing.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are raging and you confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon or a critical hit is confirmed on you (whether by a melee weapon, spell, or ranged weapon), you regain 1 round of rage (up to your maximum for the day).

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +1, half-orc or orc.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Half-orc or orc, nonlawful.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian’s rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As with a barbarian’s rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are fatigued.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 13, Diehard, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-endurance"><span class="std std-ref">Endurance</span></a>, half-orc or orc.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are killed by hit point damage, your soul lingers in your body for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. You are still dead, but a creature can make a DC 10 <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.heal.html#corerulebook-skills-heal-heal"><span class="std std-ref">Heal</span></a> check as a standard action to realize that you can still be saved. You can be healed by magic as if you were alive. If you are healed enough hit points that you would no longer be dead, you are alive again, but you gain one permanent negative level.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are raging and your attack reduces an enemy to negative hit points or kills it, you regain 1 round of rage. You may only use this feat if the fallen enemy had at least as many Hit Dice as you. You can only gain this benefit once per round.</p>

<p>This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member of a half-human race such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters the wearer’s appearance similarly to a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems.html#corerulebook-magicitems-wondrousitems-hat-of-disguise"><span class="std std-ref">hat of disguise</span></a>, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer’s non-human physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears, humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating elf ancestry. The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those familiar with his normal appearance can recognize him in his human guise.</p>

<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 10 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one quasi-real wolflike creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level (D) or 1 round/level; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none (see description); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of roiling black smoke. It functions as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.phantomsteed.html#corerulebook-spells-phantomsteed-phantom-steed"><span class="std std-ref">phantom steed</span></a>, except as noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolfâs rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed’s fear aura for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.ride.html#corerulebook-skills-ride-ride"><span class="std std-ref">Ride</span></a> check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.</p>
