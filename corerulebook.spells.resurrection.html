<p><strong>School</strong>conjuration (healing); <strong>Level</strong>cleric 7</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong>V, S, M (diamond worth 10,000 gp), DF</p>
<p>This spell functions like <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.raisedead.html#corerulebook-spells-raisedead-raise-dead"><span class="std std-ref">raise dead</span></a>, except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature.</p>
<p>The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.disintegrate.html#corerulebook-spells-disintegrate-disintegrate"><span class="std std-ref">disintegrate</span></a> spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. The subject of the spell gains one permanent <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-energy-drain-and-negative-levels"><span class="std std-ref">negative level</span></a>when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#constitution (con)"><span class="std std-ref">Constitution</span></a> drain instead (if this would reduce its <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#constitution (con)"><span class="std std-ref">Con</span></a> to 0 or less, it can’t be resurrected).</p>
<p>You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be resurrected.</p>
