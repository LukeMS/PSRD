<span id="ultimatecampaign-downtime-roomsandteams-rooms-and-teams"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Rooms and Teams</a><a class="headerlink" href="#rooms-and-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Many players want to run inns, found mercenary companies, build temples, or lead cabals of mages. The downtime system allows you to do this by presenting small constituent units: rooms for constructing buildings and teams for forming organizations.</p>
<p>A room can be as simple as a 10-foot-by-10-foot area surrounded by wooden walls, or as complex as a stone-walled guard tower with a heavy wooden gate. A team can be as simple as a few beggars or pickpockets, as skilled as a group of acolytes trained in the healing arts, or as dangerous as a band of veteran mercenary soldiers. The details of the room or team are left vague to allow you greater versatility—they provide the game mechanics for your building or organization, but you decide the layout or hierarchy that suits your aesthetics.</p>
<p>Each room and team costs one or more kinds of capital (gp, Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic). When you construct a building or create an organization, determine what rooms or teams you want, add up the gp, Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic prices for these rooms, and spend that capital to begin construction or start recruiting.</p>
<p><strong>Constructing Buildings from Rooms</strong>: If you are constructing a building, you can connect these rooms in any way you see fit using normal doors and hallways, or fit them together without interior partitions into a large common space. Unless otherwise stated, each room includes a floor, ceiling, walls, furniture, doors, windows, and other details that are appropriate to the room’s purpose in your building.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A Common Room is a large area designed for use by many people at once. In a Fort, a Common Room has tables and chairs and functions as a mess hall for soldiers. In a Tavern or Inn, it has tables and chairs and is the main place for socializing and drinking. In a Temple, it has chairs or pews and is used for conducting worship services. In a Bardic College, it has chairs and music stands and is used for practicing performances.</p>
<p>Exterior doors are good wooden doors with simple locks. Interior doors are simple wooden doors with no locks. You may install different locks by paying the normal price for locks.</p>
<p>You don’t need to construct all of a building’s rooms at once. The price of constructing a two-room building is the same whether you build them together or complete the first one and add the second one later.</p>
<p><strong>Broken Rooms:</strong> If a room takes damage in excess of half its hit points (or is otherwise rendered sufficiently damaged by a downtime event or at the GM’s discretion), it gains the broken condition. A room with the broken condition generates half the normal income. In general, repairing a broken room requires spending an amount of gp or other capital equal to half the price of constructing the room from scratch. Certain building events may have alternative prices for repairing rooms with the broken condition.</p>
<p>Entire buildings can also gain the broken condition. Treat the building as if each room in it had the condition, except you must repair the entire building at once rather than repairing rooms one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Organizations from Teams</strong>: Unless otherwise stated, the people on a team have clothing, a small amount of personal gear appropriate to their line of work, and a place to live—in other words, lives outside of their involvement with you. You may outfit them with better gear and construct or purchase a place for them to live.</p>
<p>You don’t need to add every team to your organization at once. The price for recruiting a team of beggars and a team of burglars is the same whether you recruit them together or recruit one and add the second team later.</p>
<p>The composition of a team is flexible and can change over time depending on the nature of your organization. For example, if your thieves’ guild has Cutpurses and Robbers, some of them might get caught and jailed, but it is assumed your organization replaces them with individuals of similar skill. In the same way that you don’t have to track routine maintenance on a building you own, replacing individuals who leave your organization is factored into the price of the team.</p>
<p>You can only recruit a team if the character levels of its individual members are equal to or lower than your <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-leadership"><span class="std std-ref">Leadership</span></a> score. Even if you don’t have the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-leadership"><span class="std std-ref">Leadership</span></a> feat, calculate your <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-leadership"><span class="std std-ref">Leadership</span></a> score as your character level + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, the members of a team are not adventurers and are unwilling to accompany you into dungeons and other deadly locations.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: An Acolyte is a low-level divine spellcaster. In a Cult, Acolytes are the lowest-ranked members of the group and handle most of the interactions with new converts. In a Thieves’ Guild, they are responsible for patching up members of the guild after a robbery or gang war. In a Mercenary Company, they look after the spiritual needs and physical injuries of the soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Teams and Leadership</strong>: One advantage of having followers from the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-leadership"><span class="std std-ref">Leadership</span></a> feat is that they increase the effect of Influence and Labor you spend in a settlement. As the primary component of the price of recruiting teams is Influence, having followers in a settlement makes it easier to get the word out about the organization you want to build.</p>
<p>The people in your organization obey you because you pay them, or at least keep regular contact with them and direct their activities. Unlike with cohorts and followers gained from the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-leadership"><span class="std std-ref">Leadership</span></a> feat (who are loyal toward you because of your reputation and behavior), if you’re away from your organization for a long period of time, you might lose your connection with it. In the <span class="xref std std-ref">Upkeep Phase section</span>, see Step 3—Determine Capital Attrition.</p>
<p>In addition to the ways to combat attrition mentioned in the Upkeep Phase section, recruiting your followers into your organization can help with this problem. You can automatically add followers to your organizations as you recruit teams. For every five of your followers who are also members of your organization, you gain a +1 bonus on the leadership check to avoid attrition. As most followers are low-level characters with NPC classes, most teams of followers aren’t trained for combat and are usually recruited to be Acolytes, Bureaucrats, Craftspeople, Lackeys, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Combining Rooms and Teams</strong>: This system allows you to construct a building that has no workers, create an organization that has no base of operations, or combine the two to make a fully staffed building or an organization with a headquarters. For example, if you build a Temple and recruit Acolytes in that settlement, you can have the Acolytes work at your temple. If the Temple has a place for the Acolytes to sleep, they can even live there. If you later want the Acolytes to go somewhere else or disperse, you still have the Temple and can use it for whatever purpose you see fit.</p>
<div class="section" id="reading-a-unit-stat-block">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-downtime-roomsandteams-reading-a-unit-stat-block"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Reading a Unit Stat Block</a><a class="headerlink" href="#reading-a-unit-stat-block" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The unit stat blocks are essentially the same for rooms and teams, and are organized as follows. Where an entry in a stat block would have no value (for example, a room that can’t be upgraded from or into something else), that entry is omitted from the stat block.</p>
<p><strong>Earnings</strong>: This entry indicates what bonuses the room or team gives to its building’s or organization’s checks made to generate capital. Buildings and organizations act like characters in that they can attempt a check each day to earn capital performing skilled work (without costing you any downtime). You must pay for capital earned in this way as normal.</p>
<p>If the room or team’s Earnings entry says “capital” and a number, it can contribute a bonus on the building’s or organization’s skilled work check for any type of capital (gp, Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic). If the Earnings entry lists specific types of capital, it can contribute a bonus on its building’s or organization’s skilled work checks only for capital of those types. You can apply each room’s or team’s bonus to any one listed type or capital each day or divide it among multiple listed types of capital. For example, an Alchemy Lab can generate only gp, Goods, or Magic, and not Influence or Labor. One day you could use all +10 of its bonus on the building’s capital check to generate gp, on the next day you could use +5 on a check for generating gp and +5 on a check for generating Goods, and so on.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it’s simplest and quickest to just apply all the gp bonuses from all the rooms in each of your buildings and take 10 on the roll. Other times, you might want to generate other types of capital to construct new rooms, recruit new teams, and make upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have multiple buildings or organizations in a settlement and they can generate the same kind of capital, you don’t have to roll for them separately—you may add all their capital modifiers together and attempt one check for that kind of capital. If you spend a downtime day earning capital on your own, you may add your building and organization bonuses to your roll instead of rolling separately for yourself and each of your businesses or organizations.</p>
<p>For a room, the Earnings amount already subtracts the cost of having unskilled employees to do the basic work for you. For example, the Earnings listed for having a Bar already account for the wages of a bartender and servers. For a team, the Earnings amount assumes they are working at a building you own. If you don’t provide a building for the team to work in or from, halve the Earnings for that team.</p>
<p>The description section of the unit stat block might list other benefits unrelated to the downtime system.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: The Inn example in the sidebar on page 92 has a Bar, a Common Room, a Kitchen, a Lodging, and a Stall. The Bar gives gp or Influence +10; the Common Room gives gp or Influence +7; the Kitchen gives gp or Goods +4; the Lodging gives gp +12; and the Stall gives gp, Goods, or Labor +8. All of those rooms can earn gp, so if you want to earn gp, just add all the room bonuses together (total +41) and make a skilled work check for the Inn to see how much gp you earn (see page 78). If you wanted to use the Bar’s bonus to contribute to generating Influence and use the rest of the rooms’ bonuses on gp, you’d attempt one skilled work check for Influence with a +10 modifier (the Bar’s bonus) and another skilled work check for gp with a +31 modifier (the total bonuses from the Common Room, Lodging, and Stall).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit (Rooms Only)</strong>: This entry lists what non-downtime bonuses the room provides, such skill bonuses or changes to settlement modifiers (such as Corruption, Crime, and Danger). If a room provides a skill bonus, that bonus applies only when you’re in the location specified. For example, just because you have a Ballroom in your castle doesn’t mean you get its <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perform.html#corerulebook-skills-perform-perform"><span class="std std-ref">Perform</span></a> bonus when you’re in a dungeon.</p>
<p>The stat block doesn’t list obvious benefits that aren’t related to game mechanics. For example, a Bar allows you to sell drinks, a Kitchen allows you to serve food (either for your personal guests or to paying customers if the building is an Inn), and a Magical Repository allows you to research spells.</p>
<p><strong>Create</strong>: This entry lists how much Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic are required to construct the room or recruit the team. It also includes a gp value for purchasing a completed room of that type or recruiting an existing team of that type.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: This entry indicates how long it takes to complete the room or recruit the team. You may divide the Time price for a room by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Labor price. You may divide the Time price for a team by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Influence price. You must be in the settlement at the start of the construction or recruitment period, but don’t have to spend any of your downtime days to begin construction or recruitment. In effect, you have to be present only to give the order to begin.</p>
<p>If a team doesn’t have a Time price, spending capital to recruit that team doesn’t count as a downtime action.</p>
<p>Note that the Time prices for teams are for recruiting the team for long-term employment and don’t reflect the availability of these kinds of NPCs for temporary work. For example, if you need to hire a 3rd-level cleric to cast <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.restoration.html#corerulebook-spells-restoration-restoration-lesser"><span class="std std-ref">lesser restoration</span></a>, you don’t have to spend 7 days of downtime recruiting a Priest team—you can just make standard spellcasting arrangements as described in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong>: If the unit is a room, this entry indicates a range of how many 5-foot squares are needed for a standard room of its type. For example, a Kitchen is 2—6 5-foot squares. If you need a larger room of this type, construct two rooms and join them. If you need a smaller room of this size, you can make it that smaller size for free. For example, if you only need a 5-foot-square Kitchen, you can construct one at the listed price, even though the smallest size listed is 2 5-foot squares.</p>
<p>If the unit is a team, this entry indicates how many people are needed for a standard team of its type. Typically the team is no smaller than 50% of this amount and no larger than 150% of this amount. If you need a larger team of this size, recruit two teams and combine them.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Some rooms and teams are variants of or improvements on others. You can change the room or team into the listed upgrade by spending the difference in both capital and time between the original and the new one. For example, if your building includes a Book Repository and you want to upgrade it to a Magical Repository, you can either spend 1 point of Goods, 1 point of Influence, 1 point of Labor, and 2 points of Magic, or spend 270 gp (the difference between the Create entry for a Book Repository and a Magical Repository). You must also spend 4 days (the Time difference between a Book Repository and a Magical Repository).</p>
<p>Pay the price only for types of capital that increase. For example, if you are converting Bunks into Lodging, you spend 3 points of Goods, 3 points of Labor, and 6 days; even though a Lodging costs less Influence, you don’t regain any Influence for performing this upgrade.</p>
<p>You can’t downgrade a room or team. With the GM’s permission, you may repurpose any room or team into another room or team as if the change were an upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A description of the unit follows the statistics, along with more detail about the benefits of having the unit.</p>

<span id="ultimatecampaign-downtime-roomsandteams-construction-and-recruitment-delays"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Construction and Recruitment Delays</a><a class="headerlink" href="#construction-and-recruitment-delays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the settlement’s nature is contrary to the kind of building or organization you’re trying to construct or create (such as a Black Market or Thieves’ Guild in a settlement with low Crime and high Law settlement modifiers), the GM might decide that construction or recruitment takes 1d6 Ã 10% longer than normal (minimum 1 extra day) if you aren’t monitoring the work.</p>
<p>You can shorten this extra time before or during the delay by spending 1 point of Influence, which reduces the additional time by 1d6 days (minimum 0 days of delay). You can instead have a cohort monitor the work, or hire a competent employee (see page 88) to do so; either of these options completely prevents the delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-an-organization">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-downtime-roomsandteams-moving-an-organization"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Moving an Organization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#moving-an-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can move an organization to a different settlement by paying half the price of recruiting it. This price accounts for paying relocation expenses for your teams, hiring replacements for people unwilling to move, and so on. Arranging the movement of an organization usually takes 1d6 days per team in the organization; the time needed to actually move the teams is the amount of time it takes to travel from the old settlement to the new one. The organization provides only half its benefits during the time you are arranging the move, and none of its benefits while traveling to the new settlement.</p>
<p>Instead of moving an entire organization, you can move just some of the teams within that organization. For example, if your Thieves’ Guild includes two Robber teams, you could move one of the teams to a different settlement by spending 2 points of Influence and 1 point of Labor (half the price of recruiting a Robber team in the new location). This otherwise works like moving an entire organization. You may add these teams to an existing organization in the new settlement or use them to create a new organization.</p>

<p>This simple, nondescript business uses an innocuous front to hide criminal dealings. It might appear to be a low-quality pawnshop or ill-stocked market. It has the bare necessities for functioning as the kind of business it pretends to be, but its true purpose is to conceal the nature of the building—typically a criminal enterprise or secret meeting place, such as a cult’s sanctuary or a den of thieves. The room includes a secret door leading to the rest of the building.

<p>This defensive structure prevents access to a building. It is normally arranged so defenders have a clear line of sight to all room entrances or a clear view of all approaches to the building. It includes a strong wooden door with a good lock. You can improve this to an iron door for 500 gp. You can add a wooden portcullis for 500 gp or an iron portcullis for 1,000 gp. For an additional 80 gp, you can also count this room as a Gauntlet, allowing defenders to fall back and trap intruders here. You can construct this room in a tower layout (at no additional cost), which includes a second story that also counts as a Gatehouse. The listed price includes the cost of having unskilled employees as guards (1st-level commoners or experts with uniforms, but no armor or weapons). If the building has an Armory, these employees are armed and armored, but still mostly for show. If you want trained guards who can defend against dangerous intruders, hire professional guards or recruit a team of Guards or Soldiers.

<p>Scofflaws provide illegal but consensual services such as gambling, moonshining, or underground fighting. Note that other kinds of teams might perform these services (you could recruit a Laborers team to work as prostitutes or a Guards team to run an arena, for example), but this kind of team is skilled at these tasks.</p>

<p>Soldiers are trained in combat and have the means and will to kill your enemies. Unlike Guards, Soldiers actively engage in fighting on behest of a leader (although you can make Soldiers act as Guards). Depending on the nature of your organization, they might be enforcers rather than military-style soldiers. They are typically 1st-level warriors, each with scale mail, a longsword, a heavy wooden shield, and javelins.</p>
