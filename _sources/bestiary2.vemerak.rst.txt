Special Abilities
==================
:ref:`Breath Weapon <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#breath_weapon>`\  (Su) A vemerak's acidic :ref:`breath weapon <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#breath_weapon>`\  has no effect on inorganic or :ref:`undead <bestiary.creaturetypes#undead>`\  material. If the :ref:`breath weapon <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#breath_weapon>`\  deals damage to a living fleshy creature, the acid creates a transparent cloud of foul-smelling vapor that fills that creature's space and persists for 1 round. Any creature in or passing through the cloud must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This cloud is a :ref:`poison <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#poison_(ex_or_su)>`\  effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
\ **Earthquake (Su)**\  As a full-round action, a vemerak can burrow its tentacles, legs, and mouth into the ground—this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At the start of the next round, it creates an effect identical to an :ref:`earthquake <corerulebook.spells.earthquake#earthquake>`\  spell (CL 17th). A vemerak can maintain this zone of trembling :ref:`earth <bestiary.creaturetypes#earth_subtype>`\  indefinitely, as long as it continues to take full-round actions to maintain the effect.
\ **Spore Cloud (Su)**\  A unique form of magic-resistant mold grows upon the body of a vemerak. This mold is the source of the vemerak's spell :ref:`resistance <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#resistance>`\ . When the vemerak moves, the mold exudes a cloud of spores in a 30-foot radius that acts as a targeted :ref:`greater dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic_greater>`\  (CL 17th) against the highest caster level magical effect the cloud touches as part of the vemerak's move that turn.
Huge and otherworldly, the vemerak is a monster known as much for its disturbing appearance as its violent and cruel disposition.
A vemerak is 10 feet tall and 20 feet long, its tentacle-like tails adding a further 15 feet to its length. It weighs just over 6 tons. Caverns that serve as lairs to these creatures invariably possess disturbing shrines where the creatures offer up portions of every meal to dark gods that dwell deep below the sane world—as a result, many believe that vemeraks exist as the physical manifestation of the will of a particularly violent and insane deity.
