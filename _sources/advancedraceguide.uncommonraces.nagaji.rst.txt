Nagaji
#######

The nagaji are a race of ophidian humanoids with scaled skin that mimics the dramatic appearance of true nagas. Like serpents, they have forked tongues and lidless eyes, giving them an unblinking gaze that most other races find unnerving. Their physical forms are otherwise humanlike, raising wary speculation about their origins. It is widely believed that true nagas created them as a servitor race, through crossbreeding, magic, or both, and indeed nagaji revere nagas as living gods. Nagaji often inspire awe and fear among other humanoids, as much for their mysterious ancestry as for their talent for both swords and sorcery.

Through acting as a herald to the naga deities, the aspirant is rewarded with the ability to unlock her ultimate spirit form and become a true naga. A naga aspirant has the following class features.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.nagaji#aspirants_bond`:

\ **Aspirant's Bond (Ex)**\ : A naga aspirant gains a spiritual connection to the serpentine deities worshiped by the nagas. At 1st level, and each time she gains a druid level, she may add one of the following spells to her druid spell list.

0—:ref:`acid splash <corerulebook.spells.acidsplash#acid_splash>`\ , :ref:`bleed <corerulebook.spells.bleed#bleed>`\ , :ref:`daze <corerulebook.spells.daze#daze>`\ , :ref:`mage hand <corerulebook.spells.magehand#mage_hand>`\ , :ref:`open/close <corerulebook.spells.openclose#open_close>`\ , :ref:`ray of frost <corerulebook.spells.rayoffrost#ray_of_frost>`\ ; 1st—:ref:`charm person <corerulebook.spells.charmperson#charm_person>`\ , :ref:`divine favor <corerulebook.spells.divinefavor#divine_favor>`\ , :ref:`expeditious retreat <corerulebook.spells.expeditiousretreat#expeditious_retreat>`\ , :ref:`mage armor <corerulebook.spells.magearmor#mage_armor>`\ , :ref:`magic missile <corerulebook.spells.magicmissile#magic_missile>`\ , :ref:`ray of enfeeblement <corerulebook.spells.rayofenfeeblement#ray_of_enfeeblement>`\ , :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\ , :ref:`shield of faith <corerulebook.spells.shieldoffaith#shield_of_faith>`\ , :ref:`silent image <corerulebook.spells.silentimage#silent_image>`\ , :ref:`true strike <corerulebook.spells.truestrike#true_strike>`\ ; 2nd—:ref:`acid arrow <corerulebook.spells.acidarrow#acid_arrow>`\ , :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts#detect_thoughts>`\ , :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\ , :ref:`mirror image <corerulebook.spells.mirrorimage#mirror_image>`\ , :ref:`scorching ray <corerulebook.spells.scorchingray#scorching_ray>`\ , :ref:`see invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\ ; 3rd—:ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ , :ref:`displacement <corerulebook.spells.displacement#displacement>`\ , :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\ , :ref:`lightning bolt <corerulebook.spells.lightningbolt#lightning_bolt>`\ , :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\ ; 4th—:ref:`divine power <corerulebook.spells.divinepower#divine_power>`\ , :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`\ .
