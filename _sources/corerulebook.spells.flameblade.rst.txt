A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the \ *flame blade*\ are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  modifier does not apply to the damage. A \ *flame blade*\ can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.
