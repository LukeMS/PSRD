Drow
*****

Dark elves number among the cruelest, most sadistic creatures to live above or below the surface of the world. While no intelligent race is uniformly evil or uniformly good, drow society codifies brutality, rewards viciousness, and roots out those who don't conform to the race's elevation of malice and chaos. These dogmas permeate all aspects of drow life—an existence punctuated by betrayal, assassination, calculated scheming, and baseless acts of destruction. Most cultures holding to such beliefs would quickly be consumed by the chaos they embrace, but dark elves have forged an enduring society in which civility and a caste-based hierarchy balance the ever-present machinations and acts of treachery.

Dark elves resemble their surface kin in form: lithe and graceful, with angular features and distinctly pointed ears. However, centuries of divergence have made the two races inverted reflections of one another. A dark elf's skin is either a cold blue-black, lusterless like a starless night or with a sheen akin to volcanic glass, or a deep purple, like the diluted violet of a dawn sky. Drow eyes are milky white with no pupils, adapted to an existence with little or no light. A dark elf's hair is typically white and fine.

Most surface elves think of the drow as a different race—one that represents all that "true" elves shun and have cast away. The hard truth is that the dark elves originated when a corruption transformed surface elves. The drow are proof of the lurking possibility of evil in any creature.

The true origin of the drow is shrouded in the darkness of the caverns beneath the surface of the world. After a great cataclysm drove the surface elves from their homes, many took shelter in tunnels beneath the earth. Orcs, duergar, and even fouler creatures battled them for survival in this lightless world, and time and again the elves found themselves outmatched by creatures better suited to the environment. Defeat and desperation forced them to flee deeper and deeper.

Eventually, their flight into the depths of the world brought the elves close to a mysterious source of unbridled chaos and malevolence. This influence warped their bodies and minds, granting them great power at the cost of their morality and souls. Just as they had fled their ancestral lands above, so now had they fled from what made them elves in the first place. Rather than resist this influence, the elves embraced it. The lost tribe became the first of the world's drow.

In the centuries to follow, the dark elves grew more at home in the dark. They developed supernatural powers, perfected the use of poisons, gained the ability to see in the dark, and became able to resist magical attacks. In time, they embarked upon a campaign to conquer the lands beneath the world, deeming themselves superior to all other forms of mortal life. They sought aid and further power to achieve their aims more quickly. Their priests turned to the Abyss, pledging themselves and their families to numerous demon lords—and the demons were eager to accept the drow's fealty. Favor with a demon lord became a key element to securing power within drow society.

In the ensuing millennia, the drow became the undisputed masters of their lightless realm. As they spread, they created vast underground cities ruled by fickle noble houses. Eventually, however, demonic influence and the drow's ingrained cruelty turned their focus and resolve into endless treachery. The Lords of the Abyss delight in the fractious mayhem of their vassals, regardless of whether they are slaughtering other races or each other. While such a society comprising lesser beings might have quickly collapsed, the drow's civilization endured, in part because of mercilessly enforced laws and etiquette that rein in their pitiless aspirations and most audacious betrayals.

As a result of the Abyssal compact that twisted dark elf society into what it is today, roughly one drow child in 20 is born with magical powers that far exceed those of her peers. These "noble drow" usually climb to the highest peaks of dark elf society. For reasons that remain unclear, drow nobles are almost exclusively female. This skewing of power helped shape the strong and brutal matriarchy now ingrained in drow culture.

The upper echelon of any drow settlement, underground village, or grand metropolis is uniformly female. In larger cities, drow matrons head great houses that serve as both centers for their families and power nexuses. These matrons are often clerics or wizards, as are their cadres of advisors. Regiments of trained drow warriors serve each house and its matron. The drow toiling in the direct shadow of a great house affirm their loyalty by reporting the schemes and ambitions of other servants, in an attempt to curry favor and gain the privilege of serving greater members of the house. Outside the noble houses, drow act as merchants, traders, and information brokers. Life for non-nobles is a delicate balancing act of maintaining lucrative relationships with influential houses while avoiding becoming entangled in others' feuds.

Slaves constitute the lowest level of drow society. Drow covet these captives of other subterranean races, and collect them as spoils of battle. The drow put slaves to work mining ore, constructing elaborate subterranean structures, and toiling in the great fungus beds that feed the dark elves. Most lead short, terrible lives as the drow work them to death. Slaves with specialized training like spellcasters, linguists, or sages sometimes serve in non-noble drow households, where they perform roles that drow servants fill in the greater houses. While this existence is better than that of menial laborers, the drow's relentless pursuit of social status ensures that any house that uses "common" races as servants will one day rid themselves of these markers of lower-class living.

New Rules
##########

Centuries of research, demonic influence, and exposure to bizarre materials have inspired many drow innovations.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#drow_alchemist_discoveries`:

Drow Alchemist Discoveries
***************************

The following discoveries are available to drow alchemists. These discoveries modify bombs and are marked with a dagger (\ :sup:`†`\ ) to indicate they do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#blackstar_bomb`:

\ **Blackstar Bomb**\ \ :sup:`†`\ \ **(Su)**\ : This bomb crushes the target like a void bomb, then repels nearby creatures with a burst of gravity. The target takes damage as if hit by a void bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class level in place of his Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts. Creatures moved by a blackstar bomb are pushed directly away from the target's square. An alchemist must have the void bomb discovery to create blackstar bombs.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#void_bomb`:

\ **Void Bomb**\ \ :sup:`†`\ \ **(Su)**\ : By combining the spores from strange fungi with slivers from extradimensional voids, some drow alchemists create bombs that cause bursts of gravity capable of crushing those inside. Void bombs deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st, instead of 1d6. A creature hit by the bomb must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC. If it fails, it is knocked prone and can't get up for 1 round. If it succeeds, all of its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. Other creatures within 5 feet of the bomb's target take no damage, but must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC or have all their movement speeds reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. An alchemist must be 6th level before selecting this discovery.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#drow_feats`:

Drow Feats
***********

The following feats are available to drow.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#angelbane_strike`:

Angelbane Strike
=================

You channel the power of your Abyssal patron through your weapon to punish the righteous.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Channel Smite <corerulebook.feats#channel_smite>`\ , divine caster level 5th, channel negative energy class feature, demon lord patron deity.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you use :ref:`Channel Smite <corerulebook.feats#channel_smite>`\  against a living creature with a good alignment, you treat all 1s on the channel smite damage dice as 2s.

If your target is either a good outsider or a divine caster who serves a good deity, you are considered 2 levels higher when determining how many channel energy damage dice you roll when using :ref:`Channel Smite <corerulebook.feats#channel_smite>`\ .

.. _`monstercodex.drow#shadow_shroud`:

Shadow Shroud
==============

Using a portion of your innate magic, you cloak your body in darkness to evade attacks.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Combat Reflexes <corerulebook.feats#combat_reflexes>`\ , :ref:`darkness <corerulebook.spells.darkness#darkness>`\  racial spell-like ability.

\ **Benefit**\ : As an immediate action, you can create a shifting haze of darkness around yourself, granting you concealment against one attack. The haze dissipates after the attack is resolved. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day when your caster level for your racial :ref:`darkness <corerulebook.spells.darkness#darkness>`\  spell-like ability reaches 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#snipers_lantern`:

Sniper's Lantern

.. _`monstercodex.drow#drow_equipment`:

Drow Equipment
***************

The following equipment is available in drow communities.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#light_killer_grease`: `monstercodex.drow#light_killers_grease`_

.. _`monstercodex.drow#light_killers_grease`:

Light-Killer's Grease
======================

\ **Price**\  25 gp; \ **Weight**\  —

Keenly aware of their vulnerability to light and to those who wield it as a weapon, the drow have pioneered many ways to defend themselves against light—magic or otherwise. Light-killer's grease is a pungent, oily alchemical substance harvested from underground fungus and mixed with powdered minerals common in the deep earth.

When combined correctly, this black, tarry mass absorbs light. It must be applied around a creature's eyes (a full-round action) to function. When worn, it negates the dazzled condition from exposure to bright light and grants a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the light descriptor. The grease is considered an overpowering scent for the purpose of the scent special ability, and a creature with scent can pinpoint the wearer's location at a range of 10 feet instead of 5 feet.

Once applied, the grease remains potent for 1 hour. Removing the grease is a full-round action that requires a gallon of water or another suitable washing liquid; otherwise, the visual marks can be removed, ending the effect, but the smell remains for the full duration.

Crafting light-killer's :ref:`grease <corerulebook.spells.grease#grease>`\  requires a successful DC 15 :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) check.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#spiderdrow`: `monstercodex.drow#spiderdraw`_

.. _`monstercodex.drow#spiderdraw`:

Spiderdraw
===========

\ **Price**\  40 gp; \ **Weight**\  1/2 lb.

This alchemical fluid is viscous and clear, and it emits a strong chemical smell when exposed to air. Vermin are attracted to it and perceive anything marked with it as prey. Spiders, insects, and similar vermin gain a +5 bonus on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks and attack rolls against a creature marked with spiderdraw; if these creatures have the scent ability, they can detect a marked creature at five times the normal range, note its direction as a free action, and pinpoint it when it is within 25 feet.

Drow sometimes use spiderdraw as a contact poison or splash weapon against opponents, allowing vermin to focus on the marked targets while the drow retreat, regroup, or move to a more advantageous position. Washing off the spiderdraw is a full-round action requiring at least a gallon of water or other suitable washing liquid; otherwise, the effects last for 1 hour.

Crafting \ *spiderdraw*\  requires a successful DC 20 :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) check.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#drow_magic_items`:

Drow Magic Items
*****************

The following magic items are available to drow.

.. _`monstercodex.drow#caver_bolt`: `monstercodex.drow#cavers_bolt`_

.. _`monstercodex.drow#cavers_bolt`:

Caver's Bolt
=============

\ **Price**\  6,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  1/2 lb.; \ **Aura**\  moderate evocation

Unable to use levitate like noble drow, common drow sometimes rely on these magical bolts to keep pace on climbs to the surface world or when delving deep caves.

A \ *caver's bolt*\  resembles a weighty, iron-banded crossbow bolt with a steel tip, capped with prongs and hooks. It resizes itself to fit any Small or Medium crossbow, and can be used as a nonmagical grappling arrow\ :sup:`UE`\ . The bearer loads the bolt into a crossbow, chooses a solid surface within weapon range, and speaks a command word to launch the bolt and embed it in the surface. The launched bolt trails a ghostly purple chain of force connected to the crossbow. Anyone holding the crossbow can speak a command word to retract the chain at a rate of 30 feet per round, pulling the user toward the embedded bolt. The force chain can support 500 pounds (hardness 10, 10 hp, break DC 28). Once the chain is fully retracted, the bolt can be used again. If the force chain is severed or broken, the \ *caver's bolt*\  ceases to function for 24 hours.

Extractor's Gloves
===================

\ **Price**\  5,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  hands; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

These black leather fingerless gloves are shot through with strands of giant spider webbing. They allow their wearer to steal the special abilities of an opponent's weapon and augment the wearer's unarmed strikes with the abilities instead.

Once per day, the wearer can activate the gloves by succeeding at an unarmed disarm combat maneuver against an opponent's magic weapon. Instead of disarming the weapon, the wearer can negate the weapon's special abilities (:ref:`bane <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_bane>`\ , \ *flaming*\ , and so on) for 1d4 rounds and apply these abilities to her own unarmed strikes (the weapon's enhancement bonus is unaffected). Any weapon special abilities that couldn't be applied to unarmed strikes (such as :ref:`returning <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_returning>`\  or :ref:`vorpal <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#vorpal>`\  ) are still suspended on the weapon but are not applied to the wearer's unarmed attacks.

If the wearer's unarmed strikes already have magical weapon special abilities (such as from an \ *amulet of mighty fists*\  ), the enhancement bonus and special ability bonus equivalents on the wearer's unarmed strikes can't total more than +10; stolen special abilities are discarded at random until the total is +10 or less (discarded abilities are still suspended in the opponent's weapon for the normal duration).

\ **Before Combat**\  The priest casts :ref:`shield of faith <corerulebook.spells.shieldoffaith#shield_of_faith>`\  on herself. She prefers to let her minions do the fighting, and has them stand between her and any approaching foes.

\ **During Combat**\  The priest channels negative energy at groups of foes and uses single-target spells against her most dangerous opponent (typically starting with :ref:`hold person <corerulebook.spells.holdperson#hold_person>`\  so her allies can surround the hapless target).

\ **Base Statistics**\ Without :ref:`shield of faith <corerulebook.spells.shieldoffaith#shield_of_faith>`\ , the drow's statistics are \ **AC**\  22, touch 11, flat-footed 21.

Having manipulated and assassinated her way into the middle ranks of her church, the drow priest uses her powers to eliminate rivals as she continues her climb. The drow religious orders are just as cutthroat as every other aspect of drow society. Their priests see the ability to out-scheme one's foes as a sign of the unholy favor of their demonic patrons.

A demonic champion has been tested by the powers of the Abyss and emerged stronger for it. Her soul is scarred by centuries of depraved acts, and she is irredeemable in her evil—something she is happy to prove. Demonic champions enjoy many creature comforts within drow society thanks to the spoils they claim in war, but their bloodlust motivates them to repeatedly return to battle.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Confusing Critical (Sp)**\  If an abrakarn viper confirms a critical hit against an opponent with its bite attack, the opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be confused for 1 round (as :ref:`lesser confusion <corerulebook.spells.confusion#confusion_lesser>`\  ). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +9 racial bonus.

\ **Demon-Souled (Ex)**\  Bound demonic life force animates the viper, giving it the chaotic and evil subtypes.

\ **Find Master (Su)**\  As long as an abrakarn viper and its diadem are on the same plane, the viper can unerringly find the diadem's wearer (or just the diadem, if it is removed).

\ **Guard (Ex)**\  If so ordered, an abrakarn viper defends the wearer of the diadem. All attacks against the diadem's wearer take a –2 penalty when the wearer is within the viper's melee reach.

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  An abrakarn viper's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its body. The creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds enough poison for three successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically drow poison).

\ **Shield Other (Sp)**\ The wearer of an abrakarn viper's diadem can activate this ability as a standard action when within 100 feet of the viper. This ability transfers half the damage that would be dealt to the diadem's wearer to the viper (this ability does not provide the bonuses to AC or on saving throws granted by the spell of the same name). Damage transferred in this way bypasses any defensive abilities the viper possesses (such as immunity or damage reduction).

Demonic spirits imbue this serpentine construct with the unnatural power to protect anyone who wears its diadem of control.
