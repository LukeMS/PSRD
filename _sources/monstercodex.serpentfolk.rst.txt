Serpentfolk
************

Of all the subterranean horrors known to the civilized races, few inspire as much fear and horror as the venomous serpentfolk. These cold-blooded, wholly evil reptilian masters forged a long-lasting empire on a foundation of relentless conquest, slavery, and arcane power. Driven by arrogance and avarice, they waged war in the name of their slithering god, subjugating subterranean creatures and surface dwellers alike. However, the rise of mammalian humanoids eventually gave the serpentfolk pause. History tells of the titanic struggles carried out between the serpentfolk and the greatest of humanity's progeny, a battle first waged on the sunlit surface world before it plumbed the depths of its darkest recesses.

At the climax of these wars, a cataclysmic event shook the pillars of the serpentfolk empire, severing their connection to their god and casting them into disarray. The serpentfolk were driven into retreat. Their brooding leaders went into hibernation in deep, dark holds as a strategy for outliving and outlasting their enemies. But with the passage of generations and centuries, the still-active serpentfolk guarding these strongholds devolved into degenerate brutes, only occasionally giving birth to a highborn example of their original greatness—further emphasizing the race's humiliating descent from its once noble heights. Now, their true champions slumber in ageless hibernation, waiting for the day when humanity undergoes its own decline so the serpentfolk can seize power once again.

As a race, the serpentfolk have undergone a radical transformation since the height of their lost empire. The waning of their snake-god's influence caused a sharp distinction to manifest in the original "purecaste" specimens (those with the advanced serpentfolk template), giving birth to the more commonly encountered "degenerate" serpentfolk. Yet, the twin strains within the overall race continue to intersect—a purecaste serpentfolk of genius intelligence might result from a pairing of degenerate brutes, just as a purecaste might give birth to more monstrous offspring. Regardless, all serpentfolk share a common bond, with purecastes leveraging the strengths of the degenerates to ensure their mutual survival.

On average, the typical purecaste serpentfolk stands a bit taller than its degenerate ilk at 5 to 7 feet in height, but is also far slimmer at around 100 to 140 pounds. The more powerfully built degenerate serpentfolk stands between 4 and 6 feet tall, but weighs as much as 180 to 220 pounds. The scales of all serpentfolk display a wide variety of colors and patterns, and some individuals paint themselves with pigments and cosmetics.

Serpentfolk are quite long-lived, generally reaching 500 years of age. Even so, they face a number of obstacles to returning its civilization to the heights it once enjoyed. Aside from the prevalence of degenerate offspring, most serpentfolk mate only once or twice during their lifetimes. Each mating produces as many as a dozen live births or fertile eggs up to a year later—live births now being the majority, although in ancient times egg-laying was more common—and it takes 50 years for offspring to reach adulthood. This infrequent fertility and long maturation period mean the serpentfolk are fighting an uphill battle against a dwindling population. This leads their society to lean heavily on the use of mind-controlled slaves to run the empire, especially the more dangerous tasks like mining and construction.

The diet of the serpentfolk is mostly meat—with "lesser" sentient creatures being considered a particular delicacy—along with strange fruits harvested from subterranean plants to aid digestion. Serpentfolk gorge themselves when they eat—a sensuous act kept private except for the most frenzied of feedings during major holidays and hosted events. Typically, serpentfolk dine only once per month, devouring 80 to 100 pounds of food before taking a couple of days to digest the meal. However, they can go as long as 4 months without eating at all, and some do so as part of a purifying religious experience or in preparation for complex arcane rituals.

To a serpentfolk, all creatures incapable of telepathy are lesser beings, animals fit only for use as slaves or food. Serpentfolk enclaves exist in near silence while its members communicate and debate telepathically with one another. Morally, serpentfolk have no compass except that which motivates them to action. Self-interest reigns in most matters, but serpentfolk prove incredibly efficient when uniting in common purpose. Such situations usually involve the promise of an equal reward from the spoils of war and the arcane lore gained through victory. Devout serpentfolk still rally to the cause of their snake-god, eager to restore the race to the heights it once knew. Should the serpentfolk succeed, their most powerful scions will emerge from hibernation to lead a new era of conquest and subjugation against the surface world.

Within their own culture, purecaste serpentfolk keep to themselves; each lives alone rather than sharing a living space with others of its kind, seeking to amass as much knowledge and capability as possible in its lifetime. Purecaste serpentfolk avoid emotional attachments to other creatures, including their own offspring. Males and females pair only for the purpose of mating, and then separate to pursue individual interests. Likewise, they form no bonds with the animals or slaves they keep, viewing such creatures as tools or commodities.

Purecaste serpentfolk value sensual experiences and intellectual challenges. They delight in taking that which they desire, and often challenge one another to duels or gamble their prized slaves through deadly games as a form of entertainment.

A Snake Reskinned
******************

At the height of their conflict with humanity, the serpentfolk developed an especially devious technique for cloaking their agents in impenetrable disguises to assist them in infiltrating the enemy. By enduring a bath of alchemical oils in specially prepared incubation tanks, serpentfolk volunteers would engage in a form of ritual suicide that sheds their skins and grants a form made of human flesh. This irreversible process only works on purecaste serpentfolk, and functions as :ref:`reincarnate <corerulebook.spells.reincarnate#reincarnate>`\  with the shape of the new body specifically chosen to be human rather than determined randomly. These "reborn" serpentfolk then insinuate themselves into human society, acting as sleeper agents and spies to enable the growth and success of the serpentfolk empire.

Survivors of this ritual always retain the serpentfolk intellect, including the serpentfolk's racial bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, as well as their spell-like abilities, telepathy, and immunity to mind-affecting effects. The recipient's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change according to its new race (human) as described in the :ref:`reincarnate <corerulebook.spells.reincarnate#reincarnate>`\  spell. Although they resemble humans, these reborn serpentfolk are not fertile except with other serpentfolk, and a careful examination of internal organs of one of these creatures reveals its inhuman nature.

Serpentfolk Feats
******************

Serpentfolk have access to the following feats.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#innate_arcana`:

Innate Arcana
==============

You can refresh your spell-like abilities by expending spell energy.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Arcane spellcaster, caster level 4th, serpentfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can expend two arcane spell slots or prepared spells to cast one of your racial spell-like abilities. The level of each expended spell must be equal to or higher than the sorcerer/wizard spell level of the spell-like ability you want to cast.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#serpentine_compression`:

Serpentine Compression
=======================

You can squeeze through small areas thanks to your slippery scales and lithe musculature.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Serpentfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain the compression universal monster ability, allowing you to move through an area as small as one-quarter your space without squeezing, or one-eighth your space when squeezing.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#tail_weapon`: `monstercodex.serpentfolk#tail_weapon_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#tail_weapon_(combat)`:

Tail Weapon (Combat)
=====================

You have strengthened your tail enough that you can use it to make slap attacks and augment your balance.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Base attack bonus +1, serpentfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can make a tail slap attack with your tail. This is a secondary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. You also gain a +2 racial bonus on :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to balance and to your CMD against maneuvers that attempt to move you from your square.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#telepathic_distraction`:

Telepathic Distraction
=======================

Your mastery of mental communication lets you assault and weaken the minds of your opponents.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Cha 15, serpentfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : As a standard action, you can focus your telepathy on one creature within range to weaken its resistance to mental attacks. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and take a –2 penalty against mind-affecting effects; the penalty lasts for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your Hit Dice.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#venomous_spray`: `monstercodex.serpentfolk#venomous_spray_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#venomous_spray_(combat)`:

Venomous Spray (Combat)
========================

You can spit your poison into a nearby opponent's face.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Serpentfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can spit venom as a secondary ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. This is a natural attack and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A target struck by your venom must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = your poison DC) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds and suffer the normal effects of your poison. You can't use this attack during any round in which you make a bite attack (and vice versa). After spitting venom, you are unable to use your poisonous bite or to spit venom for 1d4 rounds.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#serpentfolk_spells`:

Serpentfolk Spells
*******************

Serpentfolk often use the following spells.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#spellsteal`:

Spellsteal
===========

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous and see text

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You create a discordant blast of energy that disrupts the target's available magic and transfers knowledge of that magic to you.

If the target prepares spells, it must choose one of its prepared 3rd-level spells, which is immediately lost. If the target has no 3rd-level spells prepared, it loses a 2nd-level spell it has prepared. This progresses down to a 1st-level spell if the target has no 2nd-level spells prepared, and this spell has no effect if the target also has no 1st-level spells prepared. If the spell is on your spell list, you can cast this lost spell (using your caster level) on your next turn.

If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots. If the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing as above). Randomly select one of the target's spells known of that spell level; if that spell is on your spell list, you can cast it (using your caster level) on your next turn.

You must provide any focus or material components to cast the stolen spell.

If the target has more than one spellcasting class, choose one at random to be affected. This spell has no effect on spell-like abilities.

Any spell or spell slot lost because of this spell is treated as if the caster had failed a concentration check while trying to cast—the spell or spell slot is wasted and has no effect, but it is recovered normally the next time the character prepares spells or regains spell slots.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#sundered_serpent_coil`:

Sundered Serpent Coil
======================

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a snake scale)

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Area**\  one 5-foot square

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ : none; \ **Spell Resistance**\ : no

This spell functions like :ref:`black tentacles <corerulebook.spells.blacktentacles#black_tentacles>`\ , except it creates a Large decapitated snake, which erupts from the ground and grapples a creature you specify within its 5-foot reach. As a standard action, you can command the snake to release its grappled target and direct it to attack a different creature.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#serpentfolk_magic_items`:

Serpentfolk Magic Items
************************

Serpentfolk often use the following magic items.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#serpentine_choker`:

Serpentine Choker
==================

\ **Price**\  16,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  neck; \ **CL**\  11th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  moderate enchantment and necromancy

This finely wrought iron slave collar is embedded with flecks of pyrite and resembles a stylized rendering of a snake eating its own tail. To function, it must be placed around the neck of a helpless living creature of up to Large size. A creature that speaks the command word while touching the collar can hold the wearer accountable to a single service or course of action (as if affected by :ref:`geas/quest <corerulebook.spells.geasquest#geas_quest>`\ , DC 19) for the next 11 days.

Instead of the penalties associated with that spell, if the wearer deviates from this action or attempts to remove the collar before the service ends—either directly or by encouraging others to—the collar tightens and begins to choke the wearer into submission (as if affected by :ref:`suffocation <advancedplayersguide.spells.suffocation#suffocation>`\ ). The choking effect ends once the wearer falls unconscious. A \ *serpentine choker*\  can be removed safely if the controlling creature speaks the command word again while touching the collar, or as if it were a cursed item.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#construction_requirements`:

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`geas/quest <corerulebook.spells.geasquest#geas_quest>`\ , :ref:`suffocation <advancedplayersguide.spells.suffocation#suffocation>`

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#serpent_necked_flail`:

Serpent-Necked Flail
=====================

\ **Price**\  32,315 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  10th; \ **Weight**\  10 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

The head of this weapon resembles a knot of entwined serpents. In this form, it can be used as a masterwork heavy mace. Upon command, the head separates into three individual snakes joined to the weapon's handle by their tails, and the weapon acts as a +1 :ref:`speed <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_speed>`\  heavy flail . Speaking the command word again makes the weapon revert to its mace form.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#snakebiter_arrow`:

Snakebiter Arrow
=================

\ **Price**\  306 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  strong divination

This animated wood and metal snake squirms and hisses when handled, attempting to bite its holder just as a real snake might. To use the \ *snakebiter arrow*\  as a projectile, the bearer must first succeed at a DC 10 :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  or wild empathy check to get the snake to shape itself into a +1 :ref:`seeking <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_seeking>`\  arrow or a +1 :ref:`seeking <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_seeking>`\  bolt (this is considered a trick known by the snake) for 1 minute. Failure means the snake attacks the bearer for 1 round, using the statistics of a Tiny viper familiar. A target struck by the projectile must succeed at a saving throw or be affected by a powerful variant black adder venom (Fortitude DC 20). Normally, these items are carried in a pouch rather than a quiver to prevent them from getting loose.

Construction Requirements

A serpentfolk spy monitors activity in surface settlements, noting authority figures, defenses, and those who could be bribed or coerced into serving the serpentfolk empire. While most serpentfolk spies describe their professions in terms of analyzing weaknesses and preparing for the eventual large-scale assault on the surface world, the truth is that many spies (and their masters) have immediate goals in mind. Spies often stake out powerful priests and arcanists, posing as fellow scholars or simple servitors, in order to gain access to knowledge and arcane lore not readily available in their subterranean caverns. Given their long life spans and reptilian patience, these individuals may infiltrate an organization and stay implanted there for years, waiting for a choice artifact or tome to present itself. Once it does, the spy absconds with the relic and retreats back to the serpentfolk city of its paymasters—killing any warmbloods who stand in its way.

Trained in tracking and slaying warmblooded humanoids—humans in particular—a serpentfolk hunter is a powerful but blunt instrument of its intelligent, ruthless masters. It's often in the first wave of warriors sent to secure an area, and might serve as a bodyguard for a powerful serpentfolk priest or mage. In turn, it may well wield power and status over less specialized degenerate serpentfolk. The purecaste serpentfolk allow such hierarchical jostling among their underlings—the equivalent of letting a pack of dogs sort out their own structure—so long as their minions never question the purecastes' orders and judgments.

Despite the fact that the serpentfolk live underground, serpentfolk hunters usually train to work against a specific enemy rather than in a specific terrain. This allows them to do their job equally well when defending their cavern-cities against encroaching adventures as when making precise raids into aboveground communities. A single purecaste serpentfolk might have several different hunters working for him that all specialize in different favored enemies to maximize versatility, or he might have an entire squad trained as a unit from birth to fight a particular hated breed of surface-dwelling foe.

Tactics
========

\ **Before Combat**\  A spellblade casts :ref:`defensive shock <ultimatemagic.spells.defensiveshock#defensive_shock>`\  if it expects battle, often following with :ref:`displacement <corerulebook.spells.displacement#displacement>`\  and :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\  to pursue a chosen target more freely.

\ **During Combat**\  A spellblade combines arcane power and mental mastery with the deadly, sinuous grace of the blade. It uses its hasted assault ability whenever possible, and uses spell combat and spellstrike whenever it has appropriate spells available. It prefers to weaken opponents with poisoned bites and spells like :ref:`chill touch <corerulebook.spells.chilltouch#chill_touch>`\ , :ref:`ray of enfeeblement <corerulebook.spells.rayofenfeeblement#ray_of_enfeeblement>`\ , and :ref:`vampiric touch <corerulebook.spells.vampirictouch#vampiric_touch>`\  .

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  Bite or spit venom—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 15; \ *frequency*\  1/minute for 6 minutes; \ *effect*\  1 Con damage plus blindness for 1 minute; \ *cure*\  1 save.

\ **Spit Venom (Ex)**\  As a standard action, a seru can spit venom up to 30 feet. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this attack is exposed to the seru's poison.

A seru is an underground variety of telepathic venomous snake with the wings of a bat. These creatures have long held a special relationship with serpentfolk, and some legends suggest the snake-god created these winged vipers to assist the serpentfolk in their war against humanity. Intelligent enough to form their own culture, many serus live entirely separate lives from serpentfolk enclaves. Even so, many serpentfolk wizards still seek out serus to bind them as familiars. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be of an evil alignment, and be an arcane caster of level of 7th or higher to gain a seru familiar.

Serus are natural predators that prefer to track prey by scent. When ready to strike, they spit venom into the eyes of a victim and use ambush tactics to wear down their targets. When presented with overwhelming odds or those capable of resisting their venom, serus tend to flee and hide among their cavern rocks.

Serpentfolk often use serus to watch their territorial borders. These creatures serve both as a deterrent and as telepathic spies that can quickly alert their masters to the presence of outsiders. They sometimes enter into friendships with degenerate serpentfolk, participating in raiding parties as equal companions and trackers, or else command them by acting as mouthpieces for purecastes.

An adult seru weighs approximately 20 pounds, with a body nearly 3 feet long and a wingspan of 5 feet. A mated female lays two to five eggs every year, but many fall victim to underground predators before they ever hatch. Serus have an average life span of 25 years.

Encounters
###########

Serpentfolk can be encountered in a variety of places and contexts. Whether underground or on the surface, they seek to mislead and subjugate their enemies, dominating others as representatives of the world's most predatory civilization. Serpentfolk hunting parties frequently raid settlements and then enslave survivors—using these slaves as laborers, expendable warriors, and food. Religious pilgrims travel to seek out the holy sites of their destructive serpentine god. Living undetected among surface dwellers, illusionists and spies work tirelessly to infiltrate the power structures of other societies, taking what they covet and tearing down what they despise.

.. _`monstercodex.serpentfolk#hunting_party_(cr_8)`:

Hunting Party (CR 8)
*********************

A serpentfolk hunting party ranges far from its lair in a continual effort to explore, conquer, and enslave other creatures. An experienced tracker always leads the group, usually aided by an equally sinister lieutenant. Together, they silently command the more brutish members of their force, giving telepathic orders to direct them in battle.

****************

A cabal of serpentfolk spies usually comprises no more than five members operating under the direction of two leaders. The rest of the cell includes agents who rely heavily on :ref:`disguise self <corerulebook.spells.disguiseself#disguise_self>`\  or the reskinning ritual (see the sidebar on page 201) to hide their presence. Together, they work to sabotage the plans of their enemies and to steal any magical lore that could enhance the might of the serpentfolk empire.

Pilgrimage (CR 12)
*******************

Religion motivates many serpentfolk as they follow the strange dreams and visions provided by their half-dead snake-god—their deity charging them to make war upon all other races. Battlefields and holy sites often draw such pilgrims, who perform frenzied acts of bloodletting and feeding in an effort to appease their patron. A bone prophet typically leads these sojourns, accompanied by a handful of priests and degenerate serpentfolk to act as bodyguards and enforcers.
