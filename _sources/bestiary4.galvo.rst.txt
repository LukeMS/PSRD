Special Abilities
==================

\ **Eel Dart (Ex)**\  A galvo can launch one of its component eels like a dart up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. An eel dart deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + the galvo's Strength modifier plus 1d6 points of electricity damage.

\ **Swarmlike (Ex)**\  A galvo has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. It is also immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\ ). Mind-affecting effects that target a single creature function normally against a galvo, since the creature's individual components share a hive mind. A galvo takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects such as :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\  and splash weapons.

\ **Varied Attack (Ex)**\  A galvo's slam attack deals both bludgeoning and slashing damage since the creature is formed completely of biting eels.

In sunless ocean trenches, aberrant fleshcrafters created the first galvos to serve as soldiers in their war against the sahuagin and skum. Since those days, galvos have moved beyond their darkened trenches, breeding and expanding into shallower, warmer waters. In recent years, they have come closer to civilizations, preying on coastal communities.

A galvo can live both in the water and on land, and frightening stories tell of galvos springing up from the water to strike at prey both on ships and on beaches. A true horror to look upon, a galvo averages 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.
