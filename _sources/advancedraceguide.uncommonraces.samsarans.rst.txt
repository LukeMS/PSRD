Samsarans
##########

Mysterious humanoids with pale blue flesh and transparent blood like the waters of a trickling brook, samsarans are ancient creatures even in their youth. A samsaran's life is not a linear progression from birth to death, but rather a circle of birth to death to rebirth. Whenever a samsaran dies, it reincarnates anew as a young samsaran to live a new life. Her past memories remain vague and indistinct—and each new incarnation is as different a creature and personality as a child is to a parent. 

Samsarans appear similar to humans, with dark hair and solid white eyes with no pupils or irises. Skin tones are generally shades of light blue.

Alternate Racial Traits
########################

The following racial trait may be selected instead of existing samsaran racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting this new options.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.samsarans#mystic_past_life`:

\ **Mystic Past Life (Su)**\ : You can add spells from another spellcasting class to the spell list of your current spellcasting class. You add a number of spells equal to 1 + your spellcasting class's key ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, and so on). The spells must be the same type (arcane or divine) as the spellcasting class you're adding them to. For example, you could add :ref:`divine power <corerulebook.spells.divinepower#divine_power>`\  to your druid class spell list, but not to your wizard class spell list because :ref:`divine power <corerulebook.spells.divinepower#divine_power>`\  is a divine spell. These spells do not have to be spells you can cast as a 1st-level character. The number of spells granted by this ability is set at 1st level. Changes to your ability score do not change the number of spells gained. This racial trait replaces shards of the past.

When used during meditation, this incense allows a samsaran's consciousness to pass through past or future lives to learn more about an important person, place, or thing. This functions like :ref:`legend lore <corerulebook.spells.legendlore#legend_lore>`\ , but only works if the subject is at hand. The transcendental state lasts 1 hour, during which she can take no other actions. If she is disrupted during the meditation, the incense's effect is lost.
