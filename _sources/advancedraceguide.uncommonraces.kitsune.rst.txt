Kitsune
########

Kitsune, or fox folk, are vulpine shapeshifters known for their love of both trickery and art. Kitsune possess two forms: that of an attractive human of slender build with salient eyes, and their true form of an anthropomorphic fox. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. They delight in the arts, particularly riddles and storytelling, and settle in ancestral clans, taking their wisdom from both the living and spirits.

Quick-witted and nimble, kitsune make excellent bards and rogues. It is not uncommon for one to pursue sorcery, while those few born with white fur and pale eyes usually become oracles.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.kitsune#kitsunes_guile`:

This ability replaces trapfinding.

\ **Kitsune's Charm (Sp)**\ : At 3rd level, a kitsune trickster can use :ref:`charm person <corerulebook.spells.charmperson#charm_person>`\  once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to her rogue level – 2). At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the kitsune trickster gains an additional daily use of this ability. This ability replaces trap sense.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.kitsune#rogue_talents`:

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.kitsune#false_friend`:

\ *False Friend (Ex)*\ : A rogue with this talent gains a +4 bonus when making :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\  checks to convince someone she has never met or who doesn't know her well that they are previously acquainted or know each other well.

\ *Obfuscate Story (Ex)*\ : While another individual attempts to give an account of an event, the rogue makes an opposed :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  check to deftly interject comments or statements over the course of the storytelling that cause the individual to muddle his ability to recall accurate or specific details. If the rogue succeeds, her target remains unaware that the rogue's interjections caused the confusion. However, if she fails, the target is allowed a :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check (DC equal to the rogue's failed :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  check) to figure out that she made deliberate attempts to confuse the story.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.kitsune#steal_the_story`:

\ *Steal the Story (Ex)*\ : After muddling another's account using obfuscate story, the rogue may make another opposed :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  check to alter the details further in order to discredit, insult, or humiliate the target. If the check succeeds, the target takes a penalty on :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  and :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  checks against anyone who heard the altered story. This penalty is equal to the rogue's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest), and lasts until the target is able to repair his reputation or discredit the rogue. The rogue must have the obfuscate story talent to select this talent.
