Detect Poison
==============

\ **School**\  divination; \ **Level**\  cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target or Area**\  one creature, one object, or a 5-ft. cube

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  no

You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 :ref:`Wisdom <corerulebook.gettingstarted#wisdom>`\  check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the :ref:`Wisdom <corerulebook.gettingstarted#wisdom>`\  check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the :ref:`Wisdom <corerulebook.gettingstarted#wisdom>`\  check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
