Step 2: Creature Type or Class Graft
#####################################

With the normal monster creation system, foundational statistics such as base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and hit points are calculated from a monster's creature type and class levels. In this system, a monster's array sets its main statistics based on the broad role and CR it fits into. Creature types and classes then adjust those statistics to better resemble a particular monster concept.

Creature types and character classes are represented by "grafts"—groups of adjustments applied to an array's statistics. A monster made with this system is primarily defined either by its creature type or a character class. For example, a ghoul that is a powerful cleric would most likely use the cleric class graft rather than being defined primarily as undead. A fire giant with 3 levels in bard, on the other hand, should use the humanoid creature type graft and later choose some monster options that grant bardlike abilities.

If the focus is on a creature type, choose the appropriate creature type graft and apply the adjustments in that graft as described in the next section. If the focus is on a class, still choose a creature type graft but only apply its "automatic traits" entry, then apply the class graft. Even if a dragon has 20 levels in rogue (thus using the rogue class graft), for example, it still gets a dragon's normal vision types and immunities.

.. _`unchained.monsters.step2#creature_type_grafts`:

Creature Type Grafts
*********************

Altering an array by creature type is a simple process that typically adds or changes some of the monster's statistics. Each creature type includes at least the first two entries.

\ **Automatic Traits**\ : All creatures of this type get these abilities, which typically include senses, immunities, and more detailed sets of traits that are defined in the creature type's :ref:`full description <bestiary.creaturetypes>`\ . This doesn't include forms of movement; see :ref:`Speed <unchained.monsters.index#other_calculations>`\ .

\ **Statistic Adjustments**\ : These modifications change the base numbers from the monster's array. These are adjustments, not replacements; increase or decrease the statistics you recorded from the array by the amount indicated. Apply these adjustments to your monster only if it doesn't have a class graft.

\ **Elective Adjustments**\ : These are optional changes that can better evoke the monster's type, frequently including changes to the array's list of skills, monster options typical for this creature type (see :ref:`Step 7 <unchained.monsters.step7>`\ ), suggested spell lists, or even suggested restrictions. These should point you toward abilities that typically appear among creatures of the listed type, but aren't an exhaustive list of possibilities for monsters of that type.

.. _`unchained.monsters.step2#class_grafts`:

Class Grafts
*************

Class grafts are more detailed than creature type grafts, ensuring that they more closely represent a PC class of the appropriate level. Each class graft is divided into the following sections.

\ **Specific Rules**\ : This section appears in only some entries, and describes the class's significant requirements or features.

\ **Required Array**\ : You should use a specific array when you create a monster of this class. This is one instance in which a graft has a prerequisite, meant to match the feel of the class.

If you want to replicate a class without using the indicated array, do so without using the class graft. For example, if you wanted to create a cleric monster with the combatant array, you could still achieve a cleric's flavor by choosing the secondary magic option in Step 7. This essentially replicates a cleric built under the standard creation system that took combat feats and pre-casts many of its spells to give itself combat bonuses.

\ **Statistic Adjustments**\ : These change or replace some of the baseline numbers, skills, and options given by the monster's array. Apply the adjustments as written. Any skill listed replaces one of the choices of skills the monster gets from its array (with either a master or good bonus, as specified). If a monster gains additional skills above the normal allotment, this entry lists "one additional master skill" or "one additional good skill." The adjustments might also specify options, which replace the allotted options the monster gets from its array.

\ **CR Entries**\ : These adjustments replicate advancement by level. Apply only the highest entry to your monster: a CR 3 rogue would get the CR 3 line, but not the CR 1 line. Options gained from these entries replace options granted by the monster's array. It's possible the class graft will add more options than the monster's array allows; that's fine, and as usual you can selectively add or remove bonus options if you need to do so to make the monster function in a thematically appropriate way. See :ref:`Step 7 <unchained.monsters.step7>`\  for descriptions of these options.

\ **Suggested Ability Modifiers**\ : This section lists the recommended assignments for the monster's ability score bonuses, in order from highest to lowest. For instance, the barbarian lists "Strength, Constitution, Dexterity," meaning that when making a CR 1/2 barbarian, you would give it a +3 Strength modifier, a +2 Constitution modifier, and a +1 Dexterity modifier.

\ **Suggested Options**\ : These entries offer suggestions for cases in which the monster's array grants additional monster options beyond those determined by the class graft. They typically mimic flexible character class options, such as barbarian rage powers or rogue talents (see :ref:`Step 7 <unchained.monsters.step7>`\ ).

\ **Suggested Spell Lists**\ : Found only in class grafts for spellcaster monsters, these entries point you toward the spell lists that best replicate that class's typical spells.

.. _`unchained.monsters.step2#alchemist`:

Alchemist
==========

Alchemists stand at the crossroads of magic and science. They blend exotic chemicals and infuse them with magical power in order to create unusual and sometimes unpredictable effects.

\ **Specific Rules**\ : The spellcasting ability granted by this graft simulates the extracts an alchemist makes. The alchemist must use the alchemy spell list. Furthermore, "spells" the alchemist casts count as supernatural effects rather than spells.

\ **Required Array**\ : :ref:`Expert <unchained.monsters.step1#expert_array>`\ .

\ **Statistic Adjustments**\ : Use the combatant array's saving throws; \ *skill*\ —master :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy); \ *options*\ —bombs, mutagen, secondary magic.
