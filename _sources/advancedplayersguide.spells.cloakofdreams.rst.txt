You are surrounded by a soporific aroma that causes living creatures that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 feet of you to fall asleep for 1 minute. Creatures must save each time they begin their turn or end their movement within the :ref:`cloak of dreams <advancedplayersguide.spells.cloakofdreams#cloak_of_dreams>`\ , even if they have previously saved against the effect. Sleeping creatures are helpless but can be awakened with a standard action or after being wounded. Creatures with the scent special quality have a â€“4 penalty on their saves.
