Staves
#######

A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Staves usually hold spells grouped by a theme and sometimes possess other abilities that they grant to the wielder. A staff has 10 charges when created but can be recharged by a spellcaster with the appropriate spells.

Ember Staff
============

\ **Price**\  13,100 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  8th; \ **Weight**\  3 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate evocation

The reddish brown bark of this charred manzanita branch shows only in patches. The staff is a mere 3 feet long and balanced for use as a masterwork club.

When casting :ref:`produce flame <corerulebook.spells.produceflame#produce_flame>`\  from the staff, its wielder can choose to set the end of the staff alight instead of producing the flame in her hand. This does not damage the staff, and the spell's damage is added to any melee attacks made with the staff.

* :ref:`Produce flame <corerulebook.spells.produceflame#produce_flame>`\  (1 charge)

* :ref:`Scorching ray <corerulebook.spells.scorchingray#scorching_ray>`\  (2 charges)

* :ref:`Fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\  (4 charges)

The figures on this scrimshawed ivory staff slowly morph from one monstrous figure into another, and often grow to take up more space on the staff's surface.

Thin golden strands snake through this transparent shaft, seeming to flow from one brass end-cap to the other. Once per day when the wielder is damaged by an effect that deals at least 10 points of electricity damage, the staff regains 1 charge. This does not reduce the amount of damage the wielder takes from the effect.
