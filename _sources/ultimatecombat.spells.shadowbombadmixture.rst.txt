Shadow Bomb Admixture
======================

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  alchemist 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ special, see below; \ **Spell Resistance**\ special, see below

 Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.

When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, a shadowy substance is released from the bomb covering the direct target and up to three creatures that take damage from the bomb's splash (alchemist's choice). The affected creatures must successfully make a Fortitude saving throw, or they gain concealment but treat all other creatures as having concealment for the duration of the :ref:`shadow bomb admixture <ultimatecombat.spells.shadowbombadmixture#shadow_bomb_admixture>`\ . This effect does not ignore spell resistance.
