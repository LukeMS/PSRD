This spell has two versions.

\ *Prune Growth*\ : This version of the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of \ *diminish plants*\  automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as :ref:`entangle <corerulebook.spells.entangle#entangle>`\ , :ref:`plant growth <corerulebook.spells.plantgrowth#plant_growth>`\ , and :ref:`wall of thorns <corerulebook.spells.wallofthorns#wall_of_thorns>`\ .

At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.

\ *Stunt Growth*\ : This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to half normal. 

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.
