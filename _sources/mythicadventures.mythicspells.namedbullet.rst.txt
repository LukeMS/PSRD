Named Bullet
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`named bullet <ultimatecombat.spells.namedbullet#named_bullet>`

Increase the critical multiplier of the target weapon by 1 (maximum Ã—4).

\ **Augmented (2nd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target ammunition or weapon returns to the creature that shot or threw it just before that creature's next turn (similar to a :ref:`returning <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_returning>`\  weapon). The spell isn't discharged until the target is used to attempt a second attack against the named creature. Ammunition that hits is destroyed and doesn't return.
