Mind Swap
==========

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  medium 3, mesmerist 5, occultist 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 4, summoner 5, witch 6

\ **Casting Time**\  1 round

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

This spell is similar to \ *possession*\ , except you switch minds with the target, so instead of the target's soul sharing its body with yours and being unable to act, the target's mind moves to your body and can control it as if you each had cast :ref:`possession <occultadventures.spells.possession#possession>`\  on the other.

Mind Swap, Major
=================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  psychic 9

\ **Casting Time**\  1 minute

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (diamonds worth 10,000 gp)

\ **Target**\  one creature of your same race

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

The spell functions as \ *mind swap*\ , except as noted above. In addition, after 24 hours, instead of using each other's hit points, you each revert to your original hit points, modified by your new Constitution modifiers. This spell can be reversed only with :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle>`\ , :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish>`\ , or another \ *major mind swap*\ .
