Riding Possession
==================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  medium 2, mesmerist 4, occultist 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 3, summoner 4, witch 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level (D); see text

You stealthily project your soul into the host's body as an observer, with limited ability to influence the target. This functions as :ref:`possession <occultadventures.spells.possession>`\ , except the host is still in full control of its body and is unaware you are possessing it. You can't communicate with the host directly, but you can cast mind-affecting spells or \ *riding possession*\  on the host as long as you can cast these spells as purely mental actions. Even if the spell you cast would normally affect more than one target or an area, it can affect only the host. If the host succeeds at a saving throw against a spell that you cast in this way, it immediately becomes aware that it is possessed, and if it was already aware, it receives another saving throw against \ *riding possession*\ . :ref:`Protection from evil <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil#protection_from_evil>`\  and similar effects don't expel you from the host, but they do prevent you from casting further spells from within your host until their durations expire.
