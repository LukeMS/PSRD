Feats
******
Feats represent a special trick or ability a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his or her birth. They grant characters abilities others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most can be taken by anyone who meets the prerequisites. The feats in this book expand upon those in the \ *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook,*\ including a host of new combat feats and metamagic feats. In addition, this chapter also introduces teamwork feats, which function only when two characters with the same feat work together.

Types of Feats
###############
While most of the feats presented here are general, and have no special rules governing them, some feats have a category associated with them that involves special rules. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#combat_feats`:

Combat Feats
*************
Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming they meet the prerequisites.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#metamagic_feats`:

Metamagic Feats
****************
Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting them new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#teamwork_feats`:

Teamwork Feats
***************
Teamwork feats grant large bonuses, but they only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally who also possesses the feat to be positioned carefully on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats.

Feat Descriptions
##################
Feats are summarized on the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' description for full details.
The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#feat_name`:

\ **Feat Name**\ : The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.
\ **Prerequisite**\ : A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.
\ **Benefit**\ : What a feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#normal`:

\ **Normal**\ : What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.
\ **Special**\ : Additional unusual facts about the feat.

You can modify a spell to become more tenacious when its targets resist its effect.

A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
 Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

Thundering Spell (Metamagic)
*****************************
You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.
\ **Benefit:**\  You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell.

If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A thundering spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
 Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

**************
Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies close at hand.
\ **Prerequisite:**\  Halfling.
\ **Benefit:**\  Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\  check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to "happen" to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry—if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and "acquire" new items. You must pay for these items normally.
\ **Special:**\  At the GM's option, a character can substitute the :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  skill for :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\  with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.
