Imprisonment
=============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 9

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

When you cast \ *imprisonment*\ and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the :ref:`temporal stasis <corerulebook.spells.temporalstasis#temporal_stasis>`\  spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a \ *freedom*\ spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a \ *crystal ball,*\ a :ref:`locate object <corerulebook.spells.locateobject#locate_object>`\  spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but :ref:`discern location <corerulebook.spells.discernlocation#discern_location>`\  does. A :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  or :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\  spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a â€“4 penalty on its save.
