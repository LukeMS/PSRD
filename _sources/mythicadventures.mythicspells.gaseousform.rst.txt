Gaseous Form
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`gaseous form <corerulebook.spells.gaseousform#gaseous_form>`

The :ref:`damage reduction <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#damage_reduction>`\  changes to DR 10/epic and magic, and the fly speed increases to 30 feet. The target can expand itself as a free action, filling an area equal to double its normal space and height (a Medium creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space to a height of about 10 feet) and blocking vision as :ref:`obscuring mist <corerulebook.spells.obscuringmist#obscuring_mist>`\ . Returning from expanded to normal size is also a free action.

\ **Augmented**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of gaseous form as a move action.
