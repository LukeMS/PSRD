Touch of Fatigue
=================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 0

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately :ref:`fatigued <corerulebook.glossary#fatigued>`\  for the spell's duration.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already :ref:`fatigued <corerulebook.glossary#fatigued>`\ . Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
