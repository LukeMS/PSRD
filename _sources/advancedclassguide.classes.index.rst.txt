Hybrid Classes
###############

Most heroes progress along a single path—choosing to become a fearsome fighter, pious cleric, or mighty wizard—but some are drawn to many roads. For them, it can be hard to find a balance between abilities offered by disparate classes. Hybrid classes solve this dilemma by blending features from two classes, adding rules to make them work seamlessly together. 

\ **Parent Classes**\ : Each of the following classes draws upon two classes to form the basis of its theme. While a character can multiclass with these parent classes, doing so usually results in redundant abilities. Such abilities don't stack unless specified. If a class feature allows the character to make a one-time choice (such as a bloodline), that choice must match similar choices made by the parent classes and vice-versa (such as selecting the same bloodline).

Classes
********

The ten new classes presented in this book are all hybrids of two existing classes from the \ *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide*\ , and \ *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat*\ . The new classes are as follows.

:ref:`Arcanist <advancedclassguide.classes.arcanist>`\ : Blending the power of the sorcerer with the versatility of the wizard, the arcanist draws upon a reservoir of power to bend magic to her will.

:ref:`Bloodrager <advancedclassguide.classes.bloodrager>`\ : Fusing the frenzy of the barbarian with the bloodline might of the sorcerer, the bloodrager calls upon innate power to give himself extraordinary abilities.

:ref:`Brawler <advancedclassguide.classes.brawler>`\ : Focusing on hand-to-hand combat, the brawler mixes the martial artistry of the monk with the specialist training of the fighter.

:ref:`Hunter <advancedclassguide.classes.hunter>`\ : Though both the druid and ranger can have animal companions, the hunter takes this bond to the next level, forming a deadly duo with her savage ally.

:ref:`Investigator <advancedclassguide.classes.investigator>`\ : With the rogue's cunning complemented by the alchemist's magical talent, the investigator is a peerless problem solver.

:ref:`Shaman <advancedclassguide.classes.shaman>`\ : Calling on the divine power of the oracle and the hexes of a witch, the shaman communes with her spirit animal to unleash doom upon her foes.

:ref:`Skald <advancedclassguide.classes.skald>`\ : Sharing fury through song and deed, the skald takes the rage that lives in the heart of the barbarian and inspires it in others using the performances of the bard. 

:ref:`Slayer <advancedclassguide.classes.slayer>`\ : Mixing the precise strikes of the rogue with the special training of the ranger, the slayer hunts down his foes with ruthless efficiency.

:ref:`Swashbuckler <advancedclassguide.classes.swashbuckler>`\ : Combining the prowess of the fighter with the determination of the gunslinger, the swashbuckler is an acrobatic melee combatant.

:ref:`Warpriest <advancedclassguide.classes.warpriest>`\ : Blending the cleric's divine might and the fighter's martial skills, the warpriest brings the fight to the enemies of his faith.

Racial Favored Class Options
#############################

The rules below allow members of races from the \ *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook*\  to take alternate rewards when they gain a level in a favored class chosen from among the classes in this book. Racial favored class options were introduced in the \ *Advanced Player's Guide*\ , and expanded upon in the \ *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide*\ , which covers the base classes from the \ *Core Rulebook*\ , the \ *Advanced Player's Guide*\ , \ *Ultimate Combat*\ , and \ *Ultimate Magic*\ .

Each of these rewards replaces the normal reward for having a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank). Unlike those general rewards, these alternate favored class options speak directly to the features of specific classes and the general tendencies of various races.

Whenever you gain a level, you can choose which favored class option you take. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves.

Many of these alternate class rewards add only 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a roll (rather than 1) each time the reward is selected, or add 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a class ability (such as a bloodrager's number of bloodrages per day or a swashbuckler's total number of panache points). When applying such a benefit to a die roll or a class ability, always round down (minimum 0). You might thus need to select such an option several times before the benefit applies.

Some options have a fixed numerical limit, after which selecting such a favored class reward again has no effect. In these cases, you can always select from among the standard rewards when taking a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank).
