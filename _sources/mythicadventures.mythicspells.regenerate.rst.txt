Regenerate
===========

\ **Source**\  :ref:`regenerate <corerulebook.spells.regenerate#regenerate>`

The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a :ref:`vorpal <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#vorpal>`\  weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as :ref:`breath of life <corerulebook.spells.breathoflife#breath_of_life>`\ ), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.
