Murderous Command
==================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`murderous command <ultimatemagic.spells.murderouscommand#murderous_command>`

This spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. Each round after the first, the target can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break free of the spell.

\ **Augmented**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target attacks its nearest ally with its most powerful spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. If it has no such ability, it attacks the ally with a melee weapon or natural weapon as normal and gains a +4 morale bonus on the attack and damage rolls.
