Monk
#####

Most monks are mystic warriors, steeped in monastic traditions that fuse \ *ki*\  with martial prowess, though not all monks or monastic orders approach their mystic traditions and fighting forms in the same manner. There are even those—like the martial artist—who reject mystical traditions and seek the perfection of fighting forms without the need for \ *ki*\  mysteries. The following archetypes represent a number of ways in which monks throughout the world seek their personal and monastic forms of fighting perfection. Some, like the sensei, use their knowledge to grant wisdom to others, while the sohei and tetori represent relatively new fighting styles that surprise those who are more used to traditional monastic disciplines.

Flowing Monk (Archetype)
*************************

The flowing monk is the wind and the river. He knows how the world flows, and forces his enemies to flow with it. Even the most powerful stone breaks under the graceful and persistent pressure of wind and water. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#bonus_feat`:

\ **Bonus Feat**\ : A flowing monk replaces the normal monk bonus feats with the following: :ref:`Agile Maneuvers <corerulebook.feats#agile_maneuvers>`\ , :ref:`Combat Reflexes <corerulebook.feats#combat_reflexes>`\ , :ref:`Deflect Arrows <corerulebook.feats#deflect_arrows>`\ , :ref:`Dodge <corerulebook.feats#dodge>`\ , :ref:`Improved Reposition <advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#improved_reposition_(combat)>`\ , :ref:`Improved Trip <corerulebook.feats#improved_trip>`\ , :ref:`Nimble Moves <corerulebook.feats#nimble_moves>`\ , and :ref:`Weapon Finesse <corerulebook.feats#weapon_finesse>`\ .

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#redirection`:

\ **Redirection (Ex)**\ : At 1st level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk can attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver against a creature that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks him. If the combat maneuver is successful, the attacker is sickened for 1 round (Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + monk's Wisdom modifier to halve the duration), plus 1 additional round at 4th level and for every four levels afterward (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). The monk gains a +2 bonus on the reposition or trip combat maneuver check and the save DC for redirection increases by 2 if the attacker is using :ref:`Power Attack <corerulebook.feats#power_attack>`\  or is charging when attacking him. The benefit increases to a +4 bonus and an increase of the saving throw by 4 if both apply.

At 4th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against an opponent that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks an ally with a melee attack. At 8th level, a flowing monk can make both a reposition and a trip maneuver as part of a single immediate action with this ability. At 12th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against any opponent that attacks him in melee, even if the flowing monk is not threatening the opponent who attacks him. A flowing monk can use this ability once per day per monk level, but no more than once per round. This ability replaces stunning fist. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#unbalancing_counter`:

\ **Unbalancing Counter (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a flowing monk's attacks of opportunity render a struck creature flat-footed until the end of the flowing monk's next turn (Reflex DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#flowing_dodge`:

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#elusive_target`:

\ **Elusive Target (Ex)**\ : At 5th level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk may spend 2 points from his \ *ki*\  pool to attempt a Reflex save opposed by an attacker's attack roll to halve damage from that attack. At 11th level and above, the flowing monk suffers no damage on a successful save, or half damage on a failed save. If the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack hits the new target, that creatures  takes half damage (or full damage if the attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only half damage. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#volley_spell`:

\ **Volley Spell (Su)**\ : At 15th level, when a targeted spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome a flowing monk's spell resistance, he may reflect the effect onto its caster as spell turning by spending a number of points from his \ *ki*\  pool equal to 1/2 the spell's level (minimum 1). This ability replaces quivering palm.

\ **Flurry of Maneuvers (Ex)**\ : At 1st level, as part of a full-attack action, a maneuver master can make one additional combat maneuver, regardless of whether the maneuver normally replaces a melee attack or requires a standard action.

At 8th level, a maneuver master may attempt a second additional combat maneuver, with an additional –3 penalty on combat maneuver checks. At 15th level, a maneuver master may attempt a third additional combat maneuver, with an additional –7 penalty on combat maneuver checks. A maneuver master loses this ability when wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load. This ability replaces flurry of blows.

\ **Meditative Maneuver (Ex)**\ : At 5th level, as a swift action, a maneuver master can add his Wisdom modifier on any combat maneuver check he makes before the beginning of his next turn. He must choose which combat maneuver check to grant the bonus to before making the combat maneuver check. This ability replaces purity of body. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#sweeping_maneuver`:

\ **Sweeping Maneuver (Ex)**\ : At 11th level, a maneuver master can make two combat maneuvers as a standard action, as long as neither maneuver requires the maneuver master to move. He may perform two identical maneuvers against two adjacent enemies, or he may perform two different combat maneuvers against the same target. This ability replaces diamond body.

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#whirlwind_maneuver`:

\ **Whirlwind Maneuver (Ex)**\ : At 15th level, once per day as a full-round action, a maneuver master can attempt a single combat maneuver against every opponent he threatens, as long as the combat maneuver does not require movement.

.. _`ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.monk#exploit_weakness`:

\ **Exploit Weakness (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, as a swift action, a martial artist can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by making a Wisdom check and adding his monk level against a DC of 10 + the object's hardness or the target's CR. If the check succeeds, the martial artist gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of his turn, and any attacks he makes until the end of his turn ignore the creature or object's DR or hardness. 

A martial artist may instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks and Reflex saves and a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 his monk level until the start of his next turn.

Starting at 6th level, a master of many styles can choose to instead gain a wildcard style slot. Whenever he enters one or more styles, he can spend his wildcard style slots to gain feats in those styles' feat paths (such as :ref:`Earth Child Topple <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#earth_child_topple_(combat)>`\ ) as long as he meets the prerequisites. Each time the master of many styles changes styles, he can also change these wildcard style slots. This ability replaces a monk's standard bonus feats.

\ **Fuse Style (Ex)**\ : At 1st level, a master of many styles can fuse two of the styles he knows into a more perfect style. The master of many styles can have two style feat stances active at once.

\ **Mystic Wisdom (Su)**\ : At 6th level, a sensei may use his advice ability when spending points from his \ *ki*\  pool to activate a class ability (using the normal actions required for each) in order to have that ability affect one ally within 30 feet rather than the sensei himself. At 12th level, a sensei may affect all allies within 30 feet rather than himself (spending points from his \ *ki*\  pool only once, not once for each target).
