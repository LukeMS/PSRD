Seamantle
==========

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation) [water]; \ **Level**\  druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a cup of water)

\ **Range**\  personal 

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level

You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the :ref:`seamantle <advancedplayersguide.spells.seamantle#seamantle>`\ , but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have :ref:`freedom of movement <corerulebook.spells.freedomofmovement#freedom_of_movement>`\  effects. The cover granted by the :ref:`seamantle <advancedplayersguide.spells.seamantle#seamantle>`\  does not enable you to make :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as :ref:`cloudkill <corerulebook.spells.cloudkill#cloudkill>`\ ).

The :ref:`seamantle <advancedplayersguide.spells.seamantle#seamantle>`\  blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the :ref:`seamantle <advancedplayersguide.spells.seamantle#seamantle>`\ ; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as a bubble of steam contained within the :ref:`seamantle <advancedplayersguide.spells.seamantle#seamantle>`\  rather than its usual effect.

The :ref:`seamantle <advancedplayersguide.spells.seamantle#seamantle>`\  allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ ; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as :ref:`flame blade <corerulebook.spells.flameblade#flame_blade>`\ , :ref:`flaming sphere <corerulebook.spells.flamingsphere#flaming_sphere>`\ , or :ref:`incendiary cloud <corerulebook.spells.incendiarycloud#incendiary_cloud>`\ ). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A :ref:`flaming <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_flaming>`\  or :ref:`flaming burst <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_flaming_burst>`\  weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.
