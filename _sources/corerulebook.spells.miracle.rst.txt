Miracle
========

\ **School**\  evocation; \ **Level**\  cleric 9

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S; see text

\ **Range**\  see text

\ **Target, Effect, or Area**\ see text

\ **Duration**\  see text

\ **Saving Throw**\  see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

You don't so much cast a \ *miracle*\ as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A \ *miracle*\ can do any of the following things.

*  Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower. 

*  Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.

*  Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as :ref:`feeblemind <corerulebook.spells.feeblemind#feeblemind>`\  or :ref:`insanity <corerulebook.spells.insanity#insanity>`\ .

*  Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a \ *miracle*\ costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful \ *miracles*\ of this sort could include the following:

*  Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.

*  Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.

*  Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a \ *miracle*\ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
