Orcs
*****

Every child old enough to pick up a stick and pretend it's a sword has imagined swinging it at an orc and lopping off the imaginary foe's head. The foul creatures are so ubiquitous that every farm and village in every corner of the world has heard some tale of the green-skinned marauders sweeping down from the hills or bubbling up out of the deep places of the earth to overrun the land and destroy everything in their path.

Orcs are brutish humanoids, typically only slightly larger than humans but with much more muscle mass. They are base, squabbling creatures, living in squalor and fighting among themselves as much as with the civilized races. Orcs live by a simple code: the strong take from the weak—by force if possible. The surly savages delight in their own raw, animalistic natures, brutalizing everything they can, including themselves. They breed like vermin, so life is cheap. They live for the sake of battle and pillage, regarding the whole world as theirs for the taking. Fortunately for everyone else, orcs are usually too disorganized to realize this fantasy.

Bestial and heavily muscled, orcs stand roughly 6 feet tall. Their skin ranges in hue from dark green to sallow pink to grayish, and their coarse hair is usually black. Their teeth resemble the ferocious tusks of wild boars. Their blood-red eyes burn with hatred, and are so sensitive to light that the creatures shrink from the harsh glare of the sun, much preferring to remain in dark, subterranean places or to roam about at night.

Orcs are fond of war paint and ritual scarification, and frequently mark themselves with both before battle. They love to claim trophies, particularly the heads of enemies, which they use to adorn their camps or villages. Orcs tend to wear crude, poorly assembled clothing and use shoddy tools and weapons, though powerful combatants often don well-made armor and fight with finely crafted blades—both usually stolen on raids or from slain enemies.

Orcs have short life spans in comparison to many other humanoid races, rarely living 40 years, even if they don't die in battle first. They make up for this deficit in years through incessant breeding, and the fact that female orcs often give birth to multiple offspring with each pregnancy means that there's always a fresh supply of young orcs waiting in the wings to round out an orc warlord's armies. Orcs aren't terribly particular about who they mate with, making half-breeds a common presence within orc societies.

Orcs hate just about every other race they have encountered—they feel scorn and derision toward those they perceive as weaker than themselves, and resent the power more formidable races wield over them. They are fond of bullying smaller creatures, such as goblins and kobolds, and feel superior to humans, elves, and dwarves despite the never-ending struggle to conquer these groups' lands. Creatures held prisoner by orcs suffer terribly, and if they're lucky, they don't survive for long. Those who are captured rather than immediately slain often end up as slaves, and are either sold to outsiders or forced to serve their original orc captors until they drop dead from exhaustion. Many prisoners are eaten by their captors, while others serve as entertainment for the orcs, thrown into fighting pits where the best they can hope for is to die in battle against wild beasts or other slaves.

Orcs are bullies by nature, and every aspect of their society revolves around the idea that might makes right. An orc leader attains her position of power through intimidation and brute force, taking on challengers and defeating them in personal combat. Orcs respect a warlord or chieftain who has the battle scars to prove her mettle, but only until a younger, stronger upstart rises up to take the elder's place. When an orc is low in the pecking order, he often finds others even weaker than himself to lord over. Other humanoids, particularly goblins and prisoners captured in war, bear the brunt of weaker orcs' savagery.

Even the chieftains of different tribes jockey with one another for supremacy during times of great orc uprisings. The right to lead a powerful orc army to battle is often earned over many days of feasting, drinking, and ritual combat, and a great many hordes have fallen apart when blood matches between tribal leaders resulted in the deaths of both chiefs. More than a few orc tribes hold long-standing grudges against one another due to the murder of great chiefs and the consequent lost opportunities to invade civilized lands.

Because orcs hate sunlight, their communities are often found underground in sprawling networks of caverns and tunnels. They are known to claim vast complexes built by other races—particularly those of dwarves—as their own, and are difficult to root out. When they do dwell on the surface, orcs try to find locations that are sheltered from the sun, taking refuge in deep forests or narrow canyons. Occasionally, orcs lay claim to war-torn cities of surface dwellers, using the shelter of buildings and sewer systems to avoid the painful glare of daylight.

Most orcs care little for the mysteries of magic or unworldly questions of religion, with the exception of orc mystics and witch doctors. Like orc warriors, orc mystics and witch doctors earn their places in orc society through brutality and intimidation, and warlords and chieftains are usually wise enough to value those who exhibit the rare skill and prowess to commune with supernatural forces—as long as it helps these leaders stay on top of the pack.

Orc Feats
**********

The following feats are common among orcs, but they can be taken by other races as well.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#horn_rider`: `monstercodex.orcs#horn_rider_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#horn_rider_(combat)`:

Horn Rider (Combat)
====================

You can defend yourself using the horn or tusk of a creature you're lashed to.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Base attack bonus +1.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC when lashed into a horn harness.

\ **Special**\ : A creature with this feat can take the :ref:`Mounted Archery <corerulebook.feats#mounted_archery>`\  feat without possessing 1 rank in the :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  skill or the :ref:`Mounted Combat <corerulebook.feats#mounted_combat>`\  feat.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#horn_riders_charge`: `monstercodex.orcs#horn_riders_charge_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#horn_riders_charge_(combat)`:

Horn Rider's Charge (Combat)
=============================

When the animal you're lashed to charges, you use its momentum in your own attack.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Horn Rider, base attack bonus +1.

\ **Benefit**\ : Whenever you're lashed into a horn harness and you ready an action to make a melee attack against the target of a charge made by the creature you're lashed to, you gain the attack bonus for charging and your attack deals double damage (or triple damage with a lance). This benefit does not stack with the benefit of Spirited Charge.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#mutual_hatred`: `monstercodex.orcs#mutual_hatred_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#mutual_hatred_(combat)`:

Mutual Hatred (Combat)
=======================

Others hate you, and their hatred feeds your own.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures whose hatred racial trait or favored enemy class feature applies to you. For instance, an orc would gain this bonus against all dwarves and against rangers who chose humanoid (orc) as a favored enemy.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#scarred_legion`: `monstercodex.orcs#scarred_legion_(teamwork)`_

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#scarred_legion_(teamwork)`:

Scarred Legion (Teamwork)
==========================

Your ritual scars make you more fearsome, and allies with similar scars grow bolder when they're near you.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a +2 bonus on :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  checks. You also gain a +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws while adjacent to an ally with this feat. When you charge, if you started the charge adjacent to an ally with this feat, you retain the bonus on Will saves until the start of your next turn.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#orc_equipment`:

Orc Equipment
**************

The massive riding beasts called gortheks require special equipment to handle.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#gorthek_saddle`:

Gorthek Saddle
===============

\ **Price**\  50 gp; \ **Weight**\  75 lbs.

This unusual seat is designed so that an orc handler can sit astride a gorthek mount. Large leather straps loop around the beast's chest and neck to hold the seat in place. The saddle includes straps that drape over the orc's shoulders to help her stay mounted during violent collisions.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#horn_harness`:

Horn Harness
=============

\ **Price**\  30 gp; \ **Weight**\  20 lbs.

This simple harness, basically just a leather lash, straps a combatant's arm to the tusk or horn of a Huge or larger animal such as a gorthek. Engaging or disengaging a horn harness is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A horn harness includes a quiver that typically holds up to 12 javelins. A creature in a horn harness gains all the bonuses and takes all the penalties for engaging in combat or casting spells while mounted, but also can't do anything that requires using the hand lashed to the mount. If the mount falls in battle, the creature in the horn harness remains attached, but can attempt a DC 25 :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  check to make a soft fall. If the creature in the horn harness falls unconscious, it remains strapped in, but takes an amount of damage equal to the mount's trample damage (if any) each round the monster moves.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#orc_magic_items`:

Orc Magic Items
****************

These items are primarily made and used by orcs, though anyone can make or purchase them.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#ambush_cauldron`:

Ambush Cauldron
================

\ **Price**\  28,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  60 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

This huge, sooty cauldron has two sets of rings aligned on opposite sides. Through these rings, large shafts can be inserted in order for two bearers to lift and carry the cauldron. The inside of the oversized pot is caked with baked-on residue that smells foul and is greasy to the touch. Once per day, a horde of up to 100 orcs can consume a thick soup or gruel prepared within the cauldron. This substance makes the orcs uncannily stealthy and difficult to track. For the next 2 hours, any overland movement by the horde leaves few traces. When a creature attempts a :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  check to discover the horde's tracks, the effect negates the penalty to the DC for the number of orcs in the group.

Any non-orc who consumes even a single spoonful of the soup or gruel immediately become nauseated for 10 minutes and does not gain any benefits.

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#construction_requirements`:

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  14,000 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`pass without trace <corerulebook.spells.passwithouttrace#pass_without_trace>`\  

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#banner_of_the_rushing_horde`:

Banner of the Rushing Horde
============================

\ **Price**\  60,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  10th; \ **Weight**\  5 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

The \ *banner of the rushing horde*\  is a tattered cloth flag, typically 3 feet wide and 6 feet long, depicting the device or insignia of an orc tribe or unit. It can be carried on a staff, affixed to a pole that's planted in the ground, or hung from the harness of a great beast. Allies within 60 feet of the banner gain the benefits of the :ref:`Improved Bull Rush <corerulebook.feats#improved_bull_rush>`\  and :ref:`Improved Overrun <corerulebook.feats#improved_overrun>`\  feats. If planted, the flag does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  30,000 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`bull's strength <corerulebook.spells.bullsstrength#bull_s_strength>`\  

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#crashing_boots`:

Crashing Boots
===============

\ **Price**\  8,800 gp; \ **Slot**\  feet; \ **CL**\  8th; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

These thick, stout boots, crafted from the hide of a gorthek, grant their wearer a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls when charging. In addition, once per day when the wearer hits a Large or smaller creature with an attack, he can send his foe flying 10 feet. The foe must be thrown in a straight line away from the wearer, and lands prone at the end of the movement. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  4,400 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`bull's strength <corerulebook.spells.bullsstrength#bull_s_strength>`\ , :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#gorthek_masks`:

Gorthek Masks
==============

\ **Price**\  5,800 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  75 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

This set consists of two masks of hammered iron, one sized for a gorthek's face and the other sized for the face of its orc handler. To bond a gorthek with its handler, orcs permanently nail the \ *gorthek masks*\  to the respective wearers' faces. The magic functions only when the \ *gorthek masks*\  are affixed to one orc and one gorthek. It doesn't work with animals other than gortheks. There's only a 60% chance an orc's mask will function when affixed to a non-orc humanoid—and it's impossible to tell whether a mask will work until after it has been permanently attached.

The orc's mask is fashioned with horns on the side, resembling those of a gorthek. With its bonded gorthek, the wearer gains the benefits of :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\  and a +10 competence bonus on :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  checks.

The gorthek's mask depicts fearsome tusks, scales, or other features meant to make the creature look more terrifying. A gorthek wearing its mask ignores the first 5 points of hardness of any object it hits with a gore attack when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object. Any creature other than its handler takes a –10 penalty on :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  checks against a bonded gorthek.

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  2,900 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\ , :ref:`versatile weapon <advancedplayersguide.spells.versatileweapon#versatile_weapon>`

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#spikebones`:

Spikebones
===========

\ **Price**\  22,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  7th; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

\ *Spikebones*\  are a collection of bleached humanoid bones—typically the ribs, vertebrae, and finger bones—carried in a crude pouch made of the humanoid's skin and connective tissue. Three times per day, the \ *spikebones*\  can be cast upon the ground as a standard action to create an area of dangerous spikes. Bony in color and shape, these sharp protrusions function like a :ref:`spike growth <corerulebook.spells.spikegrowth#spike_growth>`\  spell. The spikes fill four contiguous 10-foot-square areas, shaped by the user at the time of deployment. The spikes remain effective for up to 3 hours, after which they vanish and the \ *spikebones*\  magically reappearing in their pouch.

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  11,000 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`animate dead <corerulebook.spells.animatedead#animate_dead>`\ , :ref:`spike growth <corerulebook.spells.spikegrowth#spike_growth>`

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#war_dums_of_savagery`: `monstercodex.orcs#war_drums_of_savagery`_

.. _`monstercodex.orcs#war_drums_of_savagery`:

War Drums of Savagery
======================

\ **Price**\  35,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  10th; \ **Weight**\  20 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate enchantment

Orcs turn the bodies of their slain enemies into these kettle-like drums, using the foes' skins for the drumheads and the femurs as the drumsticks. The drums come with a harness that is worn across the shoulders and back so that the drummer can play and walk simultaneously.

When \ *war drums of savagery*\  are beaten rhythmically during battle, all of the drummer's allies within 60 feet of the drums who can hear the pounding gain the effects of the :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage#rage>`\  spell. This effect lasts for as long as the drummer continues to play, but once the drumming stops, the effect can't begin again for 1 day. Allies who move within 60 feet of the drums after the drumming has begun but while they're still sounding gain the benefits of the effect. Any allies who move out of range of the drums temporarily lose the benefits of effect, but they regain the benefits when they move back within range of the drums.

If the drummer plays the \ *war drums of savagery*\  as part of a bardic performance, those affected by the :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage#rage>`\  effect don't take the penalty to AC as long as the drummer's bardic performance continues.

Construction Requirements

\ **Cost**\  17,500 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage#rage>`\

Orc Commanders
***************

The leaders of small orc warbands aren't much smarter or more cunning than the rank-and-file orc warriors they lead—but just a small advantage in strength is enough to let them take the best shares of treasure and slaves and lord their dominance over their fellow orcs. Orc commanders enforce discipline through intimidation and are not afraid to lead underlings to their deaths.

Orc Mystic
***********

Feared for their ability to commune with the brutal gods of the orc pantheon, orc mystics are far more religious than common orcs. A mystic's relationship to the gods, however, is far from reverent or scholarly—a god is only as good as the blood one can shed through the god's unholy gifts.

Orcs worship in a different way from many other races, adhering to a polytheistic tradition that varies by tribe. These gods speak to the orcs' love of fire, destruction, slavery, and the like, but the particular offerings and prayers one tribe uses for the Blood God might be the same ones a different tribe gives to the Destroyer. Orcs take little notice of these distinctions. There's no point in religious squabbling when there are villages to raid and people to slaughter.

There's seldom more than one full mystic in a tribe, though the mystic may teach the ways of divine magic to multiple apprentices. These apprentices are practically slaves to the mystic, and face beatings and starvation during their tutelage. It's not uncommon for a mystic to murder overly ambitious apprentices who seek to usurp his position in the tribe.

She then casts :ref:`fly <corerulebook.spells.fly>`\  on herself so she can cast additional spells and uses hexes from above her enemies' melee reach. The witch doctor typically spends a couple of rounds weakening her strongest foes using :ref:`enervation <corerulebook.spells.enervation#enervation>`\  and :ref:`ray of exhaustion <corerulebook.spells.rayofexhaustion#ray_of_exhaustion>`\ , then begins blasting with evocation spells.

This witch doctor scars herself to get spells from her patron, a common practice among orc witches but one that's rarely practiced by non-orcs. The witch doctor draws her power from the enduring pain of these ritualistic scars, which also give her some measure of physical protection.

The ferocious fetish mask she wears is carved from wood and is adorned with grisly remnants of people and animals, typically blood and gristle. Most witch doctors wear their masks anytime they perform magic or interact with other orcs, but some prefer to wear them only when going into battle or communing with their patrons through the masks to prepare spells.

Because most orc tribes hold divine magic in high regard, many witch doctors learn to practice a small amount of divine magic in addition to their arcane magic—or at least pretend their spells come from the gods. Feuds between mystics and witch doctors create conflict within many tribes, and most orcs side with the mystics. Often, these feuds turn into duels for supremacy.

The gorthek is, without a doubt, one of the crankiest beasts found roaming in the wilderness. Appearing as a strange combination of primeval bison and ornery rhinoceros, but with a leonine head crowned with ramlike horns, a gorthek is both immensely powerful and preternaturally hard to injure. Its thick, battering-ram head and powerful body make it a fearsome opponent, particularly when it's riled up and in full charge.

Gortheks tend to travel in small herds, grazing across remote temperate grasslands or sparsely wooded hills. When a gorthek perceives a threat—which to the gorthek includes just about everything, often even other gortheks—it launches itself into a full charge, intent on sending the enemy flying.

Orc tribes have made a practice of raising the beasts from infancy to serve as living siege engines during warfare. Future gorthek riders bond with the creatures from a very young age, and if possible use \ *gorthek masks*\  to make that bond stronger. When riding into battle, one orc sits astride the gorthek in a specially crafted saddle secured behind its massive horns and guides the beast using spiked reins.

An adult male gorthek stands about 7 feet high at the shoulder and weighs around 9,000 pounds.
