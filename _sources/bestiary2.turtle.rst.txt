Special Abilities
==================

\ **Shell (Ex)**\  As a move action, a snapping turtle can pull its extremities and head into its shell. It cannot move or attack as long as it remains in this state, but its armor bonus from natural armor increases by +4 as long as it does.

Snapping turtles are water-dwelling reptiles known for their propensity to bite anyone they deem threatening. Adult snapping turtles are usually about 1-1/2 feet in diameter. A spellcaster who can acquire a familiar can choose a snapping turtle as a familiar. A snapping turtle familiar grants its master a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves.
