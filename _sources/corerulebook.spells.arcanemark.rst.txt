This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An \ *arcane mark*\ spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\  spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

:ref:`See invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\ , :ref:`true seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\ , a \ *gem of seeing*\ , or a \ *robe of eyes*\ likewise allows the user to see an invisible \ *arcane mark.*\ A :ref:`read magic <corerulebook.spells.readmagic#read_magic>`\  spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an \ *erase*\ spell.

If an \ *arcane mark*\ is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.

\ *Arcane mark*\ must be cast on an object prior to casting :ref:`instant summons <corerulebook.spells.instantsummons#instant_summons>`\  on the same object (see that spell description for details).
