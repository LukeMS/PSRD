Alchemical Remedies
####################

Alchemical remedies are substances used to overcome a negative condition or ward against a specific kind of attack. You use most remedies by drinking them or applying them to your skin or clothing, though some remedies use other means of delivery. All of these substances can be made by a character with the :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) skill; the DC to craft each item is listed in Table 5–2: Alchemical Remedies.

Antiemetic Snuff
=================

\ **Price**\  50 gp; \ **Weight**\  —

This snuff can be used to shake off the effects of nausea. If you take it before being exposed to an effect that would give you the nauseated condition and allows a saving throw, you attempt two saving throws against the effect and take the higher result. A single dose provides this benefit for 1 hour.

.. _`advancedclassguide.gear.alchemicalremedies#blood_clotter_salve`:

Blood-Clotter Salve
====================

\ **Price**\  30 gp; \ **Weight**\  —

Applying this herbal salve to a bleeding wound cures 1 point of damage and prevents additional damage from bleeding for 1 hour per application. After an hour, if the bleed effect hasn't been properly treated, the injury resumes bleeding and more salve must be applied. Though blood-clotter salve can be applied successively to the same injury, applying multiple doses doesn't cure additional damage.

.. _`advancedclassguide.gear.alchemicalremedies#fortifying_brew`:

Fortifying Brew
================

\ **Price**\  20 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

This liquid causes a pleasant warming sensation when consumed. For the next hour, you gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. Using more than 1 dose within 24 hours causes you to become nauseated for 1 hour.

.. _`advancedclassguide.gear.alchemicalremedies#poison_ward_salve`:

Poison Ward Salve
==================

\ **Price**\  15 gp; \ **Weight**\  —

This herbal salve can be applied directly to the skin to prevent the effects of contact poisons. If a creature touches a contact poison, but you apply the salve within 1 round of contact, the victim rolls the save twice and uses the higher result.

Rager's Aid
============

\ **Price**\  25 gp; \ **Weight**\  —

This packet filled with spikey-edged leaves has a pungent scent almost strong enough to make your eyes water. While you chew the leaves, you ignore the effects of fatigue. The leaves last for 6 rounds, at which point only a wad of pulp remains. When the effect of rager's aid wears off, you are exhausted instead.
