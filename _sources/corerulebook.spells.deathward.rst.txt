Death Ward
===========

\ **School**\ necromancy; \ **Level**\ cleric 4, druid 5, paladin 4

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 standard action

\ **Components**\ V, S, DF

\ **Range**\ touch

\ **Target**\ living creature touched

\ **Duration**\ 1 min./level

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to :ref:`energy drain <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy.

This spell does not remove :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  that the subject has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  for the duration of its effect.

\ *Death ward*\ does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.
