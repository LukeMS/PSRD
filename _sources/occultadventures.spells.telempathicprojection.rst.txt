Telempathic Projection
=======================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [emotion, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  mesmerist 1, psychic 1, spiritualist 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You alter the target's mood, adjusting its attitude toward you or another creature you designate by one step either positively or negatively (see the :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  skill). You can instead use this spell to assist your own or an ally's :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ , :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\ , :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\ , or :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check, granting that check a +5 insight bonus against the target of your \ *telempathic projection*\  with no save. In this case, the spell's duration expires immediately when the skill check is complete.
