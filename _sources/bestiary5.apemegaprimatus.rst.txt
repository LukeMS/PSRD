Special abilities
==================

\ **Crash Through (Ex)**\  A megaprimatus's movement is not impeded by undergrowth, trees, rubble, and similar difficult terrain; by Medium or smaller creatures; or by allies of any size. A megaprimatus can attempt a combat maneuver to overrun a Gargantuan or smaller opponent as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

\ **Mangling Rend (Ex)**\  When a megaprimatus rends a creature or successfully uses its :ref:`Snatch <bestiary.monsterfeats#snatch>`\  feat to grapple a creature, the target also takes 1d6 points of bleed damage and reduces its movement by half for 1 minute. The ape can forgo this effect to disable one of the target's natural weapons for 1 minute, causing attacks with that weapon to take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and to deal half damage.

The apex predators known as megaprimatuses rule virtually unchallenged among prehistoric beasts in lost, forgotten realms. Highly territorial, a megaprimatus attempts to intimidate any other large, threatening creatures out of its chosen domain, and fights them if they don't retreat. Once a megaprimatus resorts to violence, it shows no mercy, and its enemy must either escape or die.

A megaprimatus's diet consists of plants—especially large bunches of fruits or melons—and meat. Larger dinosaurs and megafauna are favored prey for the beast, and the megaprimatus enjoys the fight just as much as the meal.

Creatures that clearly don't pose any danger to a megaprimatus, such as smaller dinosaurs or even humanoids, can usually coexist in its domain. A population of herd dinosaurs or a humanoid settlement can thrive in its territory as the megaprimatus chases off giant predators. People living in this sort of situation might collect large quantities of fruit and deliver it to the ape to prevent it from getting so hungry it goes on a rampage and inadvertently crashes through their homes.

Its tendency to overlook smaller creatures can lead to a megaprimatus's downfall, because it is woefully underprepared to deal with the ingenuity of humanoids, whose implements of war are powerful enough to bring down a creature even as mighty as a megaprimatus.
