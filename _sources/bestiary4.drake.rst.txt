Special Abilities
==================

\ **Magma Shake (Ex)**\  Whenever a lava drake exits from being submerged in molten rock (either magma or lava), on the next round as a full-round action, it can shake its body, flicking a fine spray of scalding molten rock in every direction. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the lava drake take 5d6 points of fire damage from the shower of scalding rock; a successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. Performing a magma shake clears the drake's scales of all excess molten rock and it must resubmerge itself in order to use this attack again. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

\ **Pyroclastic Vomit (Ex)**\  As a standard action, a lava drake can vomit forth a ball of molten rock that explodes upon striking a target, showering the target and adjacent creatures in magma. This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 19 half) to the primary target and 3d6 points of fire damage to any creatures within 20 feet of the primary target. The magma continues to burn for 1d3 rounds, dealing an additional 3d6 points of fire damage per round to the primary target and 1d6 points of fire damage per round to any secondary targets. After the magma cools, it crumbles to dust. Once a lava drake has used its pyroclastic vomit, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Speed Surge (Ex)**\ Three times per day as a swift action, a lava drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an addition move action that round.

The deviant and destructive cousins of primal magma dragons, lava drakes rise from smoldering volcanic crevasses to terrorize and devour those creatures weaker than themselves. While far less intelligent that their draconic kin, they are equally arrogant and seek out the adoration of humanoids. They can and often do submerge themselves in molten rock, burrowing through the lava to sneak up on prey, or to provide a dramatic display of power to those who worship them. Thick, black-crusted scales cover a lava drake's body.

Stockier than other drakes, adults can grow up to 18 feet in length and weigh over 3,000 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Fogburst (Su)**\  As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 Ã 5 feet from the center of the fogburst's area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as :ref:`obscuring mist <corerulebook.spells.obscuringmist#obscuring_mist>`\ ) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Fogvision (Ex)**\  A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation.

\ **Misty Camouflage (Ex)**\  A mist drake can use :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed.

\ **Speed Surge (Ex)**\  Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.

Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim's allies can regroup and come to its rescue.

Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years.

A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Shadow Blend (Su)**\  In conditions of illumination other than bright light, a shadow drake disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). It can resume or suspend this ability as a free action.

\ **Speed Surge (Ex)**\  Three times per day as a swift action, a shadow drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

\ **Stygian Breath (Su)**\  As a standard action, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black liquid that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all creatures within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources in the area effect, extinguishing nonmagical light sources and dispelling light spells of 1st level or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its stygian breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Shadow drakes are mischievous and greedy. They often use their whiplike tails as third limbs, grasping small objects or even using their tails to work locks or swipe small objects they desire. Because they are so small and fast, they are master thieves and pickpockets. Unlike most drakes and dragonkin, shadow drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused bell towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there.

A shadow drake can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat.

Young shadow drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull gray. Much like their larger dragon cousins, shadow drakes are long-lived, and can reach 150 to 200 years in age.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Accursed Breath (Su)**\  As a standard action, a spire drake can spit a compressed ball of jet-black dust that bursts into a spray of clinging motes that sap the spiritual strength of creatures in an area. The attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 5d6 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 18 half) to all creatures in a 20-foot radius. Affected creatures take a â2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1d4 rounds (or for 1 round on a successful Will save). As long as these motes cling to a creature, the effect of any conjuration (healing) effect used on that creature is halved. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Soul Corruption (Su)**\  If a spire drake successfully performs a coup de grace upon a creature afflicted by its accursed breath, the slain target arises 1d4 rounds later as a wight (\ *PRD Bestiary*\  276). This wight is not under the drake's control, and the wight and any spawn that it creates perish 1d6 days after arising.

\ **Speed**\  \ **Surge (Su)**\  Three times per day as a swift action, a spire drake can draw on its draconic reserves for a boost of strength and speed, allowing it to take an additional move action in that round.

Sages attribute the gaunt builds and tattered, scabrous wings of spire drakes to centuries of dwelling in magic-blasted desolations and accursed badlands, positing that the tainting of the land seeps into the drakes' flesh and bone and into every clutch of eggs, and is thus carried down through generations of decay. But while their appearance is somewhat withered, spire drakes are just as strong and ferocious as other drakes.

Spire drakes are unusually intelligent for their kind. They are particularly curious about magic and magical items, and enjoy having large collections of such items even if they don't know how to use them. Lacking the ability to detect magic, they often scour their hunting ranges for any items they suspect might be magical, collecting an array of strange and obscure devices and objects and displaying them proudly so they can boast to other drakes they encounter (who often jealously try to steal or destroy the collections of their rivals).

Spire drakes often demand tribute from merchants and caravans passing through or near the lands they claim, or may offer to let opponents escape a fight in exchange for surrendering a magic item. Spire drakes are rarely as clever as they think, however, and can be easily tricked by temporary magical effects into believing an item is magical. Still, spire drakes that manage to collect true magical items use them offensively or defensively as appropriate, and love to show off their latest prizes.

A typical spire drake measures 18 feet from its nose to the long, thin tip of its tail, and weighs about 1,700 pounds.
