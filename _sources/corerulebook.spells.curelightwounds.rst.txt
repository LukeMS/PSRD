Cure Light Wounds
==================

\ **School**\  conjuration (healing); \ **Level**\  bard 1, cleric 1, druid 1, paladin 1, ranger 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  half (harmless); see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless); see text

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\ , and can attempt a :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save to take half damage.
