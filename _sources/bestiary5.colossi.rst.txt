Special Abilities
==================

\ **Alternate Form (Ex)**\  As a full-round action, a sphinx colossus can take the form of a sphinx statue. The colossus becomes immobile, its DR increases to 20/epic, and it gains fast healing 10. While the sphinx colossus can't attack in this form, it can use its spell-like and supernatural abilities, and it retains its Dexterity bonus to AC. It can resume its base form as a full-round action.

\ **Create Rocks (Ex)**\  As a move action, a sphinx colossus can scoop up earth or rubble from an unoccupied square within its reach and compact it into a solid mass appropriate for use with its rock throwing ability. When it does so, the square from which the material is gathered becomes difficult terrain. No square may be used in this fashion more than once.

\ **Selective Antimagic Aura (Su)**\  Spells and abilities of the divination school are unaffected by this aura.

A sphinx colossus is an ancient relic carved by priests and god-kings to protect their secrets. A sphinx colossus stands roughly 60 feet tall and weighs about 220,000 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Alternate Form (Ex)**\  As a full-round action, a wood colossus can transform into a manor house. Each time it does so, it can choose a different internal architecture to suit its master's needs. The wood colossus can include any kind of wooden furniture in its rooms (including chairs, work benches, and the like), but can't create any objects not made out of wood. Any objects that were in the manor house when the colossus last transformed into its true form are present unless the colossus chose to expel them. The manor house can comfortably house up to 10 Medium creatures; when the colossus reverts to its true form, these creatures are expelled without taking damage. While in this form, the colossus can't make melee attacks but can use \ *telekinesis*\  at will on wooden objects inside of it.

\ **Selective Antimagic Aura (Su)**\  Spells and effects that have the light descriptor or affect plants are unaffected by this aura.

Standing 60 feet tall and weighing over 200 tons, a wood colossus can serve both as a guardian and as a manor.
