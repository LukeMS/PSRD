Animal Trance
==============

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; \ **Level**\  bard 2, druid 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  animals or magical beasts with :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  1 or 2

\ **Duration**\  concentration

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  score of 1 or 2 can be :ref:`fascinated <corerulebook.glossary#fascinated>`\  by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.
