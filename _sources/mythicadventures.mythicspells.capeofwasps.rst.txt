Cape of Wasps
==============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`cape of wasps <ultimatemagic.spells.capeofwasps#cape_of_wasps>`

The wasp swarm fills a 15-foot-by-15-foot space centered on you (or on 1 of your squares, if your space is larger than 1 square). Creatures in the area of the swarm are affected by it normally (including the swarm's :ref:`distraction <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#distraction>`\  ability). Add your tier to the swarm's distraction DC.

When you use the swarm to fly, it fills only your space, your fly speed is 30 feet (average maneuverability), and the swarm still provides partial concealment against ranged attacks.
