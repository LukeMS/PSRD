Special Abilities
==================
\ **Fire Affinity (Ex)**\  Ifrit sorcerers with the :ref:`elemental <bestiary.creaturetypes#elemental_subtype>`\  (:ref:`fire <bestiary.creaturetypes#fire_subtype>`\ ) bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Ifrit spellcasters with the :ref:`Fire <bestiary.creaturetypes#fire_subtype>`\  domain use their domain powers and spells at +1 caster level.
Ifrits are humans whose ancestry includes beings of elemental fire, such as efreet. Ifrits have pointed ears, red or mottled horns on the brow, and hair that flickers and waves as if it were aflame.
All ifrits are at some level pyromaniacs. Adoring fire in all its forms, they tend to be passionate and quick to action, with a predilection for striking first in any conflict—a trait which keeps them alive but doesn't make them a lot of friends. Ifrits generally seek out the company of either less-powerful minions who can be browbeaten into following orders, or calm, cool individuals who can balance the ifrits out.
