House Spirit
*************

These sometimes-helpful fey creatures known as house spirits bind themselves to rural families and live among them. Some bear a resemblance to the family's ancestors, a similarity that grows more obvious the longer they remain in the family's service. House spirits use their compression ability and invisibility to stay out of the sight of those among whom they live.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Telekinesis (Su)**\  A domovoi defends itself and its home through telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell \ *telekinesis*\ , usable at will, with a caster level equal to the domovoi's Hit Dice (CL 5 for most domovoi). A typical domovoi has a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 14 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The work never ends for those who live on farms or in small villages, and the wise often seek the aid of the fey folk while pursuing their daily chores. A family might leave a piece of bread under the stove or an old boot in the closet to attract a domovoi to their home. Domovoi help with small tasks like churning butter and mending clothes, but mostly protect the home from intruders and misfortune. These helpful fey can also tell the fate of the family they protect, but grow annoyed when asked to do so too often. A domovoi appears as small, old man no more than 2 feet tall, covered in hair and with a long, shaggy beard.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Oversized Weapons (Ex)**\  A dvorovoi can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.

\ **Wild Empathy (Ex)**\  This ability works like the druid ability of the same name. The dvorovoi's total bonus includes a +8 racial bonus.

Just as domovoi protect the home, dvorovoi protect villagers' yards and pastures. Intrigued by tales of the creatures' guardianship, some farmers lure dvorovoi to their fields by leaving offerings of bread, sheep's wool, or shiny trinkets. When the owner of a farmstead with a dvorovoi purchases a new animal, he leads it through the yard to introduce it to the dvorovoi, hoping to gain the fey creature's approval of the new livestock.

Though undeniably useful to have around for feeding the cattle and keeping predators away from flocks, dvorovoi can be capricious. Dvorovoi despise any white animal, and will never tolerate a white-furred horse or cow in their presence. For unknown reasons, dvorovoi don't hold this same grudge toward white chickens.

\ **Treasure**\  none

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Luck Touch (Su)**\  With a claw attack or touch attack, an ovinnik can alter a creature's luck. If the target fails a DC 14 Will save, it either gains a +4 bonus or takes a -4 penalty (the ovinnik's choice) on its next three d20 rolls. The target can choose to automatically fail the saving throw, but must choose before it knows whether the touch will be beneficial or harmful. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Ovinniks make their homes in granaries and drying houses. These thin, sleek, black-furred humanoids stand only a foot high. Their eyes and features seem catlike, but they bark like dogs to scare away thieves. No one knows why an ovinnik chooses to take up residence in a particular farm's threshing house, and few would call on them willingly. A wise farmer placates resident ovinniks with frequent gifts of warm milk, pancakes, or dead roosters. By tradition, before the new year, farmers and their families go to the granary to learn their fates for the future. The ovinnik touches each of them in turn. If the ovinnik's touch is warm, the person will have good luck; if cold, she will suffer terrible misfortune in the days ahead.
