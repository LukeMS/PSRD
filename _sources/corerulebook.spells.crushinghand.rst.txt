Crushing Hand
==============

\ **School**\ evocation [force]; \ **Level**\ sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions as :ref:`interposing hand <corerulebook.spells.interposinghand#interposing_hand>`\ , except that it can also grapple one opponent as :ref:`grasping hand <corerulebook.spells.graspinghand#grasping_hand>`\ . Its :ref:`CMB <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_bonus>`\  and :ref:`CMD <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_defense>`\  for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its :ref:`Dexterity <corerulebook.gettingstarted#dexterity>`\  is 10, granting no bonus to the :ref:`CMD <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_defense>`\ ). A \ *crushing hand*\ deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The \ *crushing hand*\  can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as :ref:`forceful hand <corerulebook.spells.forcefulhand#forceful_hand>`\ ), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as :ref:`interposing hand <corerulebook.spells.interposinghand#interposing_hand>`\  does.
