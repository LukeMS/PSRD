Special Abilities
==================

\ **Feeding Tentacles (Su)**\  As a standard action, a yangethe can use its mouth tentacles to feed on a helpless creature or a creature it is currently grappling. In this case, if the yangethe hits with a melee touch attack, the feeding tentacles wrap around the target's body and riddle it with thousands of tiny filaments that siphon away the victim's emotions. This attack deals 1d4 points of Charisma drain. The yangethe heals 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma it drains in this manner. As long as a creature continues to suffer any of this Charisma drain, each time it attempts to sleep, it is affected by a \ *nightmare*\  spell (CL 10th, DC 20) and has terrifying dreams wherein the experience of being fed upon by the yangethe takes on greater and greater levels of horror. All effects from the feeding tentacles are mind-affecting effects.

\ **Psychic Blast (Su)**\  Once per day as a standard action, a yangethe can emit a blast of psychic energy from its mind in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on itself. All creatures in this area take 6d6 points of nonlethal damage from the intense pain and are confused for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 18 Will save halves the damage and negates the confusion. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

One of the countless creatures bred and engineered by eldritch horrors from beyond the stars, yangethes have, over the eons, developed keen intellects and desires of their own. Unless slain by violence, a yangethe is immortal.
