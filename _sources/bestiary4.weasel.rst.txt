Common in a variety of environments and climates, dire weasels are larger relatives of normal weasels. They're relentless predators known for their fearless nature and killing frenzies, and are dangerous to farmsteads and settlements—they not only prey on cattle and horses, but also target humanoids. Those that do often become obsessed with the taste of that flesh and hunt such prey exclusively.

Sometimes, dire weasels are trained to be mounts by evil humanoids—usually by bugbears or hobgoblins.

Measuring 12 feet long, a dire weasel stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 900 pounds.

Like their smaller cousins, giant weasels have long, slender bodies and short legs, and come in a variety of colors from reddish brown to snowy white. Giant weasels are active and tenacious predators, and have a reputation for being as clever as they are quick. Both highly aggressive and extremely territorial, they frequently attack creatures that are much larger than they are.

Giant weasels are often trained to serve as guards and mounts by  various Small humanoids. Adult giant weasels can grow to be 5 feet long, stand as high as 2-1/2 feet tall at the shoulder, and weigh up to 150 pounds.
