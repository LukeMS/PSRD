Microcosm
==========

\ **School**\  illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  psychic 9

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one or more creatures

\ **Duration**\  permanent

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will partial (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You plunge the targets' minds into a veiled immersive mindscape of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose combined total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer gets no saving throw, one of 11â€“15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level you possess on a successful save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates the effect on a successful save. Given time, the bodies of creatures whose minds are trapped in a \ *microcosm*\  can die of starvation and thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor enter a \ *microcosm*\ , even via a :ref:`mindscape door <occultadventures.spells.mindscapedoor#mindscape_door>`\ . \ *Microcosm*\  can be ended only by :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle>`\  or :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish>`\ .

Creatures inside a \ *microcosm*\  can be affected by mind-affecting effects targeted against their real bodies. However, they perceive them as natural events within their inner mindscape. Multiple creatures affected by the same \ *microcosm*\  can interact with one another within the mindscape.
