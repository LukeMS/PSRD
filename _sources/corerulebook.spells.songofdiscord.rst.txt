Song of Discord
================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; \ **Level**\  bard 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\ medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Area**\  creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a \ *song of discord*\ to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen :ref:`unconscious <corerulebook.glossary#unconscious>`\ .
