Break
======

\ **Source**\  :ref:`break <advancedplayersguide.spells.break#break>`

You can target up to 1 Medium or smaller object per caster level.

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, target objects gain the broken condition on a successful save and are destroyed on a failed save. This doesn't affect mythic objects or objects held or carried by mythic creatures.
