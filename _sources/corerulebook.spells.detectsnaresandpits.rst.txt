Detect Snares and Pits
=======================

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  60 ft.

You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

\ *Detect snares and pits*\ does detect certain natural hazardsâ€”quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). It does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\  traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell :ref:`snare <corerulebook.spells.snare#snare>`\ ), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

\ *1st Round*\ : Presence or absence of hazards.

\ *2nd Round*\ : Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

\ *Each Additional Round*\ : The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to examine a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
