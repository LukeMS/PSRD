Special Abilities
==================

\ **Breath Weapon (Su)**\  A khala can fire a jet of frigid liquid from one of its three mouths, dealing 16d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 27 half). Even if they succeed at the Reflex save, creatures caught in the line must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be encased in ice. A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength check or DC 26 Escape Artist check as a full-round action to break free.

\ **Disease (Ex)**\  \ *Chillbane Fever*\ : Bite—injury; \ *save*\  Fortitude DC 27; \ *onset*\  1 day; \ *frequency*\  1/day; \ *effect*\  1d4 Con damage, sickened, and fatigued; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.

\ **Tenacious Grapple (Ex)**\  A khala does not gain the grappled condition if it grabs a foe with its tail, and it can maintain a grapple with its tail as a swift action.

It is rumored that khalas were a breed of rare amphibious dragon, warped through evil and wintry magic from proud creatures into voracious and wicked things that delight in the suffering of others. The creature ambulates like a snake, slithering along the ground or through the boughs of trees with its wings drawn close to its body, but it prefers flight whenever possible. All khalas are female, and scholars debate how the creatures procreate. It is believed that the males of the species, known in legend as the zmeys, were wiped out in a war with the khalas.
