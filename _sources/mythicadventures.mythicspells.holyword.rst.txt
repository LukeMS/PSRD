Holy Word
==========

When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nongood creatures that fail their saves also take a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.
