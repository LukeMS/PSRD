An \ *arcane lock*\ spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own \ *arcane lock*\ without affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  or :ref:`knock <corerulebook.spells.knock#knock>`\  spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A :ref:`knock <corerulebook.spells.knock#knock>`\  spell does not remove an \ *arcane lock;*\ it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.
