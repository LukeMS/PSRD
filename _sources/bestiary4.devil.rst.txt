Special Abilities
==================

\ **Drown (Su)**\  As a full-round action, a drowning devil can summon murky water into the lungs of a single target within 30 feet. If the target can't breathe water, it's unable hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. At the start of its next turn, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save to cough up this water or it falls unconscious and is brought to 0 hit points. On the next round, the target must save successfully again or drop to â1 hit point and start dying; on the third round it must save successfully again or die. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Heavy Aura (Su)**\  Whenever a creature enters the drowning devil's heavy aura, it must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or reduce its speed as if carrying a load one step higher or wearing armor one category heavier (whichever is worse), and its armor check penalty increases by 2. A creature already carrying a heavy load or wearing heavy armor that fails its save can't move as long as it remains in the affected area. A creature that saves against a drowning devil's heavy aura is immune to that devil's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  Slam—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 20; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d4 Str; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.

Called sarglagons in their Infernal tongue, drowning devils take great pride in being the best-adapted guardians of Hell's waterways, and are among the few fiends who travel the seas and rivers of the multiverse as part of larger infernal plots. Even in the air or on the ground, a drowning devil moves with a haunting litheness as though it were swimming.

A typical drowning devil weighs 600 pounds, and can exceed 15 feet from head to tail.

\ **Treasure**\  standard (mwk ranseur, other treasure)

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Master Grappler (Ex)**\  A magaav can wield a weapon and still attempt grapple checks. While not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks.

\ **Noxious Breath (Su)**\  Three times per day, as a standard action a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Shared Senses (Su)**\  All magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire swarm instantly. It is still possible for a magaav to be flat-footed for other reasons even if other magaavs nearby are not.

Hunters of souls, host devils retrieve Hell's most elusive property. Whether souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends fly from the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in great swarms that often number in the thousands. These four-winged mockeries of the angelic form swarm in enormous columns, moving in tandem as though they were one colossal, infernal beast controlled by a single brain.

Magaavs stand 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds, with wingspans reaching 10 feet across. Their fetid breath draws flies that swarm over their bodies.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Devil Mark (Su)**\  An advodaza can grant worthy servants a measure of its power. As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing creature, marking it with a unique symbol. For as long as the creature is marked, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see false divinity, below). The target can also telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance while on the same plane. An advodaza can dismiss its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, cause pain to a mark bearer that deals 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to a number equal to its Hit Dice (typically 18).

\ **False Divinity (Su)**\  Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (5th level and lower) of that domain as spell-like abilities. Each of these abilities can be used 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, Trickery, War, or Weather domains, though any domains except Good or Chaos are possible. These spell-like abilities are not included in the stat block above.

\ *Evil Domain*\ : :ref:`align weapon <corerulebook.spells.alignweapon#align_weapon>`\  (evil only), :ref:`dispel good <corerulebook.spells.dispelgood#dispel_good>`\ , :ref:`magic circle against good <corerulebook.spells.magiccircleagainstgood#magic_circle_against_good>`\ , :ref:`protection from good <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromgood#protection_from_good>`\ , :ref:`unholy blight <corerulebook.spells.unholyblight#unholy_blight>`

\ *Fire Domain*\ : :ref:`burning hands <corerulebook.spells.burninghands#burning_hands>`\ , :ref:`fire shield <corerulebook.spells.fireshield#fire_shield>`\ , :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\ , :ref:`produce flame <corerulebook.spells.produceflame#produce_flame>`\ , :ref:`wall of fire <corerulebook.spells.walloffire#wall_of_fire>`

\ *Trickery Domain*\ : :ref:`confusion <corerulebook.spells.confusion#confusion>`\ , :ref:`disguise self <corerulebook.spells.disguiseself#disguise_self>`\ , :ref:`false vision <corerulebook.spells.falsevision#false_vision>`\ , :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\ , :ref:`nondetection <corerulebook.spells.nondetection#nondetection>`

\ *War Domain*\ : :ref:`divine power <corerulebook.spells.divinepower#divine_power>`\ , :ref:`flame strike <corerulebook.spells.flamestrike#flame_strike>`\ , :ref:`magic vestment <corerulebook.spells.magicvestment#magic_vestment>`\ , :ref:`magic weapon <corerulebook.spells.magicweapon#magic_weapon>`\ , :ref:`spiritual weapon <corerulebook.spells.spiritualweapon#spiritual_weapon>`

\ *Weather Domain*\ : :ref:`call lightning <corerulebook.spells.calllightning#call_lightning>`\ , :ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ , :ref:`ice storm <corerulebook.spells.icestorm#ice_storm>`\ , :ref:`obscuring mist <corerulebook.spells.obscuringmist#obscuring_mist>`\ , :ref:`sleet storm <corerulebook.spells.sleetstorm#sleet_storm>`

\ **Idol Armor (Su)**\  Advodazas armor themselves in fallen idols and ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +7 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell :ref:`dismissal <corerulebook.spells.dismissal#dismissal>`\ . The spells :ref:`chaos hammer <corerulebook.spells.chaoshammer#chaos_hammer>`\ , :ref:`holy smite <corerulebook.spells.holysmite#holy_smite>`\ , :ref:`holy word <corerulebook.spells.holyword#holy_word>`\ , and :ref:`word of chaos <corerulebook.spells.wordofchaos#word_of_chaos>`\  destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and its immunities (its cold immunity is replaced with the devil's normal cold resistance of 10). The armor is automatically destroyed if the advodaza is slain. If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection.

\ **Infernal Wound (Su)**\  An advodaza's assaults leave vicious marks that do not easily heal. The damage an advodaza inflicts with its claws leaves persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to stanch—a successful DC 29 :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  check is required to stop the bleeding, and anyone attempting to magically heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 29 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects. The :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  check DC and caster level DC are Constitution-based.

False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils—all are names for the fiends known collectively as advodazas. They survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits that masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to restore their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are shades of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, and fiends of blasphemy: the idol-clad advodazas.

Fantastically ancient beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages, typically as part of primitive and deranged cults. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen to protect them from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard the early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladia, and all manner of cult images. Yet as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were either forgotten or demonized and rooted out.

All advodazas desire to eventually return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. Though merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortals because of the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or to violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, advodazas' servants find no divine realm, nor do they sit beside some grand deity. When they die, there is only Hell.

No two advodazas look exactly alike. Each one embodies the powers and spheres of influence for which it was worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal and half-bestial shapes that bristle with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith—in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons—and bristle with archaic power and unquenchable arrogance. Despite this wide range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess augmented or even unique abilities.

Most advodazas stand about 18 feet tall and weigh approximately 9 tons.
