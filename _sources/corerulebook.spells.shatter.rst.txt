\ *Shatter*\ creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.

Used as an area attack, \ *shatter*\ destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.

Alternatively, you can target \ *shatter*\ against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), \ *shatter*\ deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save for half damage.
