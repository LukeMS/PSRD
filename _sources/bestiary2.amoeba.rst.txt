A giant amoeba is a shapeless mass of living, liquid protoplasm. Though naturally translucent with darker interior spots, its surface is slightly sticky and tends to collect dirt and other debris from its environment; therefore, a moving giant amoeba looks like muddy water. A weaker cousin of creatures such as the gray ooze and black pudding, a giant amoeba is actually a mutated version of a harmless creature too small to be seen by the naked eye, grown dangerously large in size. Although happy to prey on creatures smaller than it, the giant amoeba's constant hunger often drives it to attack larger prey, such as humanoids.

Amoeba Swarm
*************
Thousands of tiny gelatinous clots of animate ooze swarm in a wet mound, surrounded by a cloying stink of rancid vinegar.

An amoeba swarm is a mobile group of amoebas, each about the size of a coin. Giant amoebas may cleave off tiny portions of their substance, which can then become amoeba swarms. At other times, a giant amoeba can spontaneously transform into a swarm, usually if the giant amoeba is starving or in an area with a high concentration of magic. Likewise, a well-fed amoeba swarm may fuse into a single giant amoeba.
When an amoeba swarm is found in the vicinity of a giant amoeba, the two oozes ignore each other. A giant amoeba in the space of an amoeba swarm takes no damage from the swarm's attacks and does not run the risk of becoming distracted as a result of being in the swarm.
