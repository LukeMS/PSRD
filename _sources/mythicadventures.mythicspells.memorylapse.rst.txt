Memory Lapse
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`memory lapse <advancedplayersguide.spells.memorylapse#memory_lapse>`

The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn.

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using :ref:`modify memory <corerulebook.spells.modifymemory#modify_memory>`\  but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldn't implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldn't happen in the forgotten length of time.

The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the \ *mythic memory lapse*\  DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.
