A miasmal form roils as barbed tentacles emerge from the central mass, coalescing into razor-sharp talons and claws.

Special Abilities
==================
\ **Gaseous (Ex)**\  A mihstu can pass through small holes, even cracks, without reducing its speed.
\ **Deadly Embrace (Ex)**\  A mihstu that pins an opponent completely surrounds that creature and deals 1d2 Constitution damage every round as it siphons away blood, tears, and other vital fluids. Maintaining a pin is a free action for a mihstu and it does not gain the grappled condition (allowing it to attack other creatures with its tentacles).
Susceptible to :ref:`Cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  (Ex) Magical :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  stuns a mihstu rather than damaging it. If the creature fails its save against a magical :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  effect, it is stunned for 1 round and then staggered for an additional 1d4 rounds.
\ **Wind Defense (Ex)**\  The churning winds of a mihstu\ *'*\ s body automatically deflect nonmagical projectiles (such as arrows, bolts, and sling stones). All other ranged weapons (including magical projectiles and thrown weapons) have a 20% miss chance. Weapons of significant size, such as giant-thrown boulders, siege engine projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected by this ability.
The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floorâ€”the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty.
Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs.
