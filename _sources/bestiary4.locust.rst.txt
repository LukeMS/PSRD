Special Abilities
==================

\ **Leap (Ex)**\  A giant locust can take 10 on :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to jump even if distracted or in danger.

\ **Spit (Ex)**\  A giant locust can spit a brown jet of acid and partially digested food up to 30 feet with no range increment.

\ **Voracious (Ex)**\  A giant locust's bite attack deals double damage to creatures with the plant subtype and to objects made of paper, wood, or other plant materials.

Giant locusts have a hunger akin to their smaller cousins, but only rarely do they gather in the endless numbers of their tiny kin.

A mature giant locust measures just over 4 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Devour (Ex)**\  A locust swarm causes damage to unattended objects in its space each round as though they were creatures. It even damages inedible objects.

Under crowded conditions, these normally inoffensive relatives of the grasshopper change color, breed uncontrollably, ravenously consume any available vegetation, and wreak vast destruction to farms and settlements.

The largest swarms, known as plagues, can include billions of locusts and cover hundreds of square miles. Locusts in these swarms are larger and more aggressive than common ones, making the swarm a true danger to everything edible in their path and even to inedible objects as well.
