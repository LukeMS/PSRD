Special Abilities
==================

\ **Encage (Ex)**\  As a swift action, an urannag can encage a creature that shares its space and is not aware of it or a helpless creature it has entrapped. The target treats the urannag's space as difficult terrain, and cannot move out of that space unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save. Each round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 points of slashing damage. A creature can try to escape by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag's CMD) as a full-round action, or it can try to smash through a cage wall. These walls have an Armor Class of 22, hardness 10, and 22 hit points. A wall with a hole smashed in it automatically repairs itself. The save DC is Strength-based.

\ **Exposed Mechanisms (Ex)**\  Although an urannag is a construct, it can be harmed by the methods used to disable traps. A successful DC 20 Disable Device check targeting an urannag (a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity) deals damage that bypasses the urannag's DR equal to 3d6 + the character's total ranks in Disable Device. Additionally, the urannag is staggered for 1 round (DC 16 Fortitude negates the staggered condition).

\ **Living Trap (Ex)**\  Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as trap sense) apply against an urannag's attacks.

Urannags have long vexed scholars, some of whom contend that they're creatures, while others argue that they're complex traps. In truth, they're both—an unsettling example of how reality on the Abyss doesn't match mortal expectations. An urannag behaves like an ambush predator, yet has no need for sustenance and is driven to flense prey out of innate sadism.

Construction
*************

Most urannags are created spontaneously by Abyssal energies, but enterprising spellcasters have found methods to duplicate the construction of these creatures. An urannag's body is made of 2,000 pounds of iron worth 200 gp, and its frame must be forged over an Abyssal heat source, which infuses the creature with its chaotic and evil urges.
