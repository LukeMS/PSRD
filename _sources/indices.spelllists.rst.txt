Spell List Index
#################

\ **Order of Presentation**\ : The first spell lists presented are the lists of spells separated by class and level. These include the spell name and a brief and incomplete description of the spell. Immediately after those lists is a complete list of all spells with full descriptions of those spells listed. Spells in all lists are presented in alphabetical order, except when a spell's name begins with "communal," "greater," "lesser," or "mass," in which case it is alphabetized under the base spell name.

\ **Hit Dice**\ : The term "Hit Dice" is used synonymously with "character levels" for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures.

\ **Caster Level**\ : A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purposes of casting a particular spell. The word "level" in the short spell descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.

\ **Creatures and Characters**\ : The words "Creature" and "character" are used synonymously in the short descriptions.

\ **Communal Spells**\ : Communal spells function like other spells, except they allow you to divide the duration among multiple targets, treating each target as a subject of the spell. When you divide the duration, you must divide it as evenly as possible among the targets. Furthermore, unless the communal spell's description indicates otherwise, no target can receive a duration increment smaller than the smallest increment of duration listed in the spell description. For example, if you are 5th level, your communal spell's duration is 10 minutes per level, and you have four targets, each target must receive 10 minutes of duration. The extra 10 minute duration can go to one of the four targets or it is wasted.
