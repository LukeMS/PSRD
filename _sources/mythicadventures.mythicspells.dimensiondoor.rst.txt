Dimension Door
===============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`dimension door <corerulebook.spells.dimensiondoor#dimension_door>`

The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per 2 caster levels, and it creates a temporary, invisible, one-way portal in your square to your destination. You immediately pass through the portal and arrive at the destination, but you can't take any other creatures with you.

When casting the spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. These creatures can see and use the portal, passing through it to arrive at the destination (this isn't an action). A creature that passes through the portal can't take any other actions until its next turn.
