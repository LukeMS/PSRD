Expeditious Retreat
====================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`expeditious retreat <corerulebook.spells.expeditiousretreat#expeditious_retreat>`

The speed bonus from the spell increases to 40 feet. Add your tier to :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to avoid attacks of opportunity from movement, and when your movement provokes an attack of opportunity, add your tier to your AC against that attack.
