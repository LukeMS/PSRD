Sending
========

\ **School**\  evocation; \ **Level**\  cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

\ **Casting Time**\  10 minutes

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (fine copper wire)

You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  score as low as 1 can understand the \ *sending,*\ though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\ . Even if the \ *sending*\ is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the \ *sending*\ does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)
