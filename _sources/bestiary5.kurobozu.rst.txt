Special Abilities
==================

\ **Disease (Su)**\  \ *Black apoxia*\ : Steal breath —inhaled; \ *save*\  Fort DC 18; \ *onset*\  1 day; \ *frequency*\  1/day; \ *effect*\  1d3 Con damage and exhausted; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.

\ **Echo of Life (Su)**\  A kurobozu retains some the same disciplined training it had in life. It gains the monk's evasion, AC bonus, :ref:`Stunning Fist <corerulebook.feats#stunning_fist>`\ , and flurry of blows class features and unarmed strike damage as a monk of equal level to its Hit Dice. A kurobozu's :ref:`Stunning Fist <corerulebook.feats#stunning_fist>`\  lasts 1 round longer than normal. In addition, a kurobozu replaces its Constitution modifier with its Wisdom modifier instead of its Charisma modifier.

\ **Sage's Bane (Su)**\  Any target struck by a kurobozu's unarmed strike takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and loses an equal amount of ki (Fortitude DC 18 negates both). For every point of Wisdom damage a kurobozu deals, it heals 5 hit points. Hit points received in excess of the creature's normal total are treated as temporary hit points and dissipate after 1 minute. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

\ **Steal Breath (Su)**\  As a standard action, a kurobozu can steal the breath from a stunned or helpless target, as per the spell \ *suffocation*\ , except it never causes the victim to die. Regardless of whether it successfully saved, the victim can't speak for 1 minute, and its breath reeks of carrion. This also exposes the victim to the kurobozu's disease.

Kurobozus, also called black monks, are jealous undead that arise when a monk dies under circumstances that violate the precepts of his or her monastic training. Kurobozus need to feed upon the breath of mortals to survive, and they usually acquire this sustenance by sneaking up on a sleeping victim, though they can just as easily draw breath from a foe stunned by their fists in combat. While this feeding doesn't immediately kill the victim, it leaves a horrific rotting scent on the victim's breath that can spread the kurobozu's contagious apoxia to others, eventually leading to faintness, exhaustion, and death.

When they aren't maintaining their existence through feeding, kurobozus carry out their jealous fantasies by murdering living monks, especially members of their former monastery or monastic tradition. They still possess a shred of their former discipline, which they use to formulate long-term plans for their acts of revenge. Generally, kurobozus' interactions with other creatures are limited to feeding and killing, but they have an affinity for malcontent ex-monks and may actually go out of their way to secretly offer protection or succor to such a person, without ever revealing their true identities. Evil ex-monks seeking to destroy their former masters and fellow disciples may even see the actual face of their benefactors and be able to forge lasting alliances.
