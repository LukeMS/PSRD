Enshroud Thoughts
==================

\ **School**\  abjuration [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  alchemist 2, bard 2, inquisitor 2, medium 2, mesmerist 2, psychic 2, ranger 3, shaman 2, witch 2

\ **Target**\  you\ **Duration**\  10 minutes/level (D)

You become warded against the mental prying of others, including the effects of divination spells such as :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts>`\  and :ref:`seek thoughts <advancedplayersguide.spells.seekthoughts#seek_thoughts>`\ , as well as enchantment spells such as :ref:`modify memory <corerulebook.spells.modifymemory#modify_memory>`\  and :ref:`memory lapse <advancedplayersguide.spells.memorylapse#memory_lapse>`\ . If another creature attempts to target you with a mind-affecting spell that detects or alters your thoughts or memories, the caster must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level or the spell fails. Only spells that detect or alter your thoughts or memories are blocked by this spell; effects such as :ref:`clairaudience/clairvoyance <corerulebook.spells.clairaudienceclairvoyance>`\ , :ref:`detect evil <corerulebook.spells.detectevil#detect_evil>`\ , and :ref:`locate creature <corerulebook.spells.locatecreature>`\  continue to affect you as normal.
