Skill Unlocks
##############

Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the Signature Skill feat (see below) can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the :ref:`revised version of the rogue <unchained.classes.rogue>`\ , who uses her rogue's edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and bard, particularly in comparison to the rogue. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the Signature Skill feat, limiting skill unlocks to rogues and rogues alone.

Signature Skill (General)
**************************

Your ability with a particular skill is the stuff of legends, and you can do things with that skill that others cannot.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : 5 ranks in the chosen skill.

\ **Benefit**\ : Choose one skill. You gain the ability listed in that skill's 5 Ranks entry. As you gain more ranks in the chosen skill, you gain additional abilities. If you have 10 or more ranks in the chosen skill, you gain the appropriate abilities immediately. If your chosen skill is :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\ , :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\ , :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\ , or :ref:`Profession <corerulebook.skills.profession#profession>`\ , you gain the listed powers only for one category of that skill, such as :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (bows). This feat can be taken only once, but it stacks with the rogue's edge ability and the cutting edge rogue talent.
