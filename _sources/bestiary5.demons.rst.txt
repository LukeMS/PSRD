Special Abilities
==================

\ **Destructive Attacks (Ex)**\  An abrikandilu's natural attacks can threaten and confirm critical hits against objects. In addition, an abrikandilu gains a +5 racial bonus on Strength checks to break or destroy objects.

\ **Hatred of Mirrors (Ex)**\  An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature (at the GM's discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror.

\ **Mutilation (Su)**\  An abrikandilu's bite causes horrific and hideous wounds that not only mar beauty but supernaturally diminish a creature's sense of self-worth. A creature bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty stacks, up to a -5 penalty, and it lasts even after the wounds are healed. The penalty slowly fades with time, diminishing by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Known as wrecker demons, abrikandilus delight in destroying beauty, be it by rending a fine painting to shreds, reducing a magnificent statue to rubble, or scarring a lovely face. Abrikandilus are formed from the souls of mortals who vandalized art or defaced objects of exquisiteness, particularly those whose acts of destruction were born from jealousy. All abrikandilus loathe only one thing more than beauty—their own reflections. Curiously, the faces of other abrikandilus do not vex a wrecker demon, but the sight of its own deformed shape drives an abrikandilu into a furious, brutish anger, impelling it to focus all of its energy on breaking the object, usually a mirror, in which it can see itself.

Abrikandilus are often used as ground troops in demonic wars, for they are excellent grunts on the battlefield and don't require weapons or armor to excel at combat. Their penchant for demolishing works of art functions as an additional demoralizing element in battle, for even when abrikandilus are defeated, the damage they have dealt endures as a constant reminder of the value of what they destroyed.

An abrikandilu stands 4 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Sadistic Strike (Su)**\  Cambions excel at causing pain and anguish. Cambions always treat any weapons with which they attack (including natural weapons and spells with attack rolls) as if they had the :ref:`Improved Critical <corerulebook.feats#improved_critical>`\  feat for the weapons.

\ **Sinfrenzy (Su)**\  Every cambion carries an excessive capacity for one of the seven classical sins, determined at the moment of the cambion's birth and depending on the nature of his humanoid parent's greatest sin. Once per day for a number of rounds equal to his Hit Dice, a cambion can embrace his sin and enter a frenzied state as a free action. While a cambion is in this frenzy, his land speed increases by 10 feet and he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and attack rolls. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by \ *haste*\  or similar effects, but if the cambion has at least 1 level in the class listed for his specific sin, the sinfrenzy grants an additional effect.

 \ *Envy (cleric)*\ : Cambion clerics covet the gods' power. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their channel energy effect increases by 1d6.

 \ *Gluttony (alchemist)*\ : Cambion alchemists enjoy drinking extracts, potions, mutagens, and even poisons. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their bombs deal an additional die of damage.

 \ *Greed (rogue)*\ : Cambion rogues are obsessed with gathering wealth and power. When they are in a sinfrenzy, cambion rogues deal an additional die of sneak attack damage.

 \ *Lust (bard)*\ : Cambion bards seek to dominate and control others, turning them into slaves. When cambion bards are in a sinfrenzy, the bonuses granted by their inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics abilities increase by 1. The save DCs of their bardic performances also increase by 1.

 \ *Pride (wizard)*\ : Cambion wizards believe their magic is the greatest. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their spell save DCs increase by 1.

 \ *Sloth (fighter)*\ : Cambion fighters bleed slowly. When entering a sinfrenzy, they gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die that disappear when the sinfrenzy ends.

 \ *Wrath (ranger)*\ : Cambion rangers attack with savage hatred. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their favored enemy bonuses increase by 2.

When an incubus procreates with a humanoid in the Abyss, and the mortal parent resides on that plane throughout the pregnancy, the gestating child absorbs enough Abyssal energy to be born not as a half-demon, but as a type of humanoid demon known as a cambion.

Cambions are true outsiders. The majority of cambions have red skin, horns on their heads, and cloven hooves for feet—the fiendish aspects of cambions' appearance don't range as widely as those of tieflings. A typical cambion stands 6 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Blood Healing (Su)**\  Whenever a creature within 30 feet of a seraptis takes bleed damage caused by that seraptis, the blood flows through the air into the seraptis's maw, and the seraptis heals an equal amount of damage.

\ **Compelling Domination (Su)**\  When a seraptis uses :ref:`dominate person <corerulebook.spells.dominateperson#dominate_person>`\ , its victims do not actively resist and never gain a new saving throw when ordered to take actions against their nature.

\ **Gaze of Despair (Su)**\  Creatures within 30 feet of a seraptis that fail a DC 22 Will save take 1d6 points of Charisma drain and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. If the Charisma drain would reduce a creature's Charisma to 0, that creature instead succumbs to overwhelming suicidal urges and attempts to end its life by the most convenient method at hand, subject to the GM's discretion. The creature remains in that state until its Charisma is restored to its normal maximum—otherwise, the victim must be restrained at all times to prevent further suicide attempts. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Multi-Arm Grab (Ex)**\  When a seraptis successfully grabs a creature, the maws on her arms begin to gnaw on it. This ability functions as constrict, except the damage type is bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. A seraptis gains a cumulative +4 bonus on grapple attempts with her grab ability for each successive claw attack after the first that hits a given target that round.

Seraptis demons form from souls of those who inspired widespread despair or destruction by committing suicide.
