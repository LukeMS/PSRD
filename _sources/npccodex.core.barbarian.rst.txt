Dorremera Salin
================

Dorremera is a child of the waves, sired by an aquatic elf who abandoned her human mother. Raised along the sea, Dorremera took to the water as if born to it, and considers the beasts of the sea and shore her kin. She has little patience for the niceties of society—whether human or elven—and lashes out at almost everyone who crosses her path. 

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Dorremera has no compunctions about stealing from landlubbers, or killing those who chase or surprise her.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Though it is hard to get through to her, Dorremera sometimes parleys with adventuring groups that treat her respectfully, show great battle prowess, or are particularly kind to sea creatures.

Graun Quor
===========

Graun the pit fighter was raised in lawless borderlands where control changed hands frequently and unpredictably. The one constant was the thirst for blood sports, and any youth with a hard edge and more greed and ambition than fear could make a name and a fortune so long as he survived. Graun mastered many weapons throughout his career, but loves best the orc double axe he took as a prize in an early championship bout. Having long since bought his freedom, Graun wanders the borderlands selling his skills to the highest bidder. A few orc tribes have offered Graun leadership roles, but he has little patience for such things and cares nothing for the welfare of his allies.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Graun can be found at the head of an orc band on rare occasions, either a tribe he has adopted for a short time or who serve as fodder for his hunts. Other times he stalks the wild lands looking for opponents worthy of his fighting skills.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Graun sometimes ventures into civilized lands to spend his coin and search for blood sports, hoping for a chance to kill in front of a crowd.

Jemar Crowell
==============

Jemar Crowell is a champion of his people, a savage emissary of vengeance in the never-ending wars between the dwarfholds and giant-kin of all kinds. Often clad head to toe in stout dwarven steel armor, Jemar sometimes doffs his helmet to better taunt enemies as he brings them low. He keeps his scalp shaved save for two narrow crests of hair. His cape is woven from shaggy skeins of loosely-spun giant hair clipped from his vanquished foes, and when the weather is cold he wears scarves and mittens knit from the same material.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Jemar is a focused combatant, going after his prey and protecting his people's interests to the exclusion of all other concerns. He has no qualms about stealing kills and looting bodies.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  When not slaying giants, Jemar plans raids on giant strongholds, and considers those who trade with giants as bad as giants themselves. Though he primarily works for dwarven interests, he often hires sellswords and adventurers to aid him on particularly dangerous hunts.

.. _`npccodex.core.barbarian#finnogh_llew`:

Finnogh Llew
=============

Having mastered horses while still a child, Finnogh seeks out the wildest and most untameable beasts the world has to offer. Though he's keenly interested in learning which savage beasts can best be tamed, he cares less about mastery than the thrill of the ride. Eventually he turns loose even those animals he has broken to the bit, though more from boredom than altruism.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Always on the search for exotic beasts to serve as mounts, Finnogh often resides in or near the lairs of strange creatures.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Finnogh is quick to query adventurers about any strange creatures they might have encountered, and may join them on a hunt for such beasts.

\ **Before Combat**\  The barbarian uses her wand of :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\  before most battles, but also uses her wand of :ref:`mirror image <corerulebook.spells.mirrorimage#mirror_image>`\  if she expects a difficult fight or a battle against a strong lone enemy.

\ **During Combat**\  The barbarian closes quickly to make full attacks with her hooked hammer, using the :ref:`thundering <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#thundering>`\  pick end as her primary weapon and the hammer as her off-hand attack. If she has to charge or otherwise move between attacks, she makes a single two-handed :ref:`Power Attack <corerulebook.feats#power_attack>`\  with the pick end. She uses moment of clarity to trigger a wand or scroll if the situation demands, such as in an encounter with a flying or invisible foe. She prefers to reserve her :ref:`boots of speed <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#boots_of_speed>`\  for when she is already in melee, to facilitate full attacks or to close the distance on faster enemies.

Krida Grichenwald
==================

Krida studies the link between emotional states and magic. Though she's so far been unable to focus her rage into magic, she believes it is only a matter of time. When friends and family tried to dissuade her, Krida quite literally sacrificed them, murdering some swiftly in paranoid vengeance but gruesomely torturing others in her search for non-existent magical secrets.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Krida's obsession drives her to attack those who obviously possess magic items.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Krida may search out spellcasters in order to pick their brains about rage magic, but she soon becomes frustrated and hostile to them.

\ **Before Combat**\  The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies without them noticing, and uses his :ref:`chime of opening <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#chime_of_opening>`\  to break into locked strongholds.

\ **During Combat**\  The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat, using poison against a target's weakest ability score if he knows his target in advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or flee.

Sibusiswe Njai
===============

Sibusiswe is a fierce and feral elf with the grace of a panther, and claims that she communes with animistic spirits of the forest and savannah. A loner, she prowls the wildlands, appearing and disappearing like a flash of lightning. 

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Sibusiswe follows the dictates of the animalistic spirits that she believes guide her. Because of this, her attacks can be unprovoked—as much as a surprise to her as to her victims.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Sibusiswe's spirits are capricious, but also inquisitive. An encounter with the elf is just as likely to end in a parley as it is to end in combat.

Gorgu Stonesplitter
====================

Once an ordinary dwarven warrior, Gorgu Stonesplitter was captured and enslaved by fire giants who shaved his beard, and burned and scarred his face. After years of toil in their mines, he gained his freedom when the giants' king was overthrown by a group of adventurers. Gorgu threw his lot in with them in the hope of taking his revenge on the giants' masters. While he learned much, killing could not restore his pride or his faith in his people, nor slake the rage in his heart. Since taking his leave from his companions, he has roamed the world in search of purpose. He fights now for the fun of it, and his temper has gradually cooled to dark embers. Still, he might join any nearby fray on any side. Should anyone land a blow he notices, he might begin to fight in earnest.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  A glutton for battle, Gorgu fights for anyone or any cause that might offer a challenge.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Every so often, Gorgu seeks out powerful adventurers to lead him to an impossible foe—which he secretly plans to take down single-handedly.
