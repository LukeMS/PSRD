Bloatbomb
==========

\ **School**\  necromancy [acid, death]; \ **Level**\  antipaladin 4, cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  living creature touched

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous and 1 minute/level (see text)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude negates or Reflex half (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

The target creature dies if it fails a Fortitude saving throw and its Hit Dice are no more than half your caster level. If it dies, its corpse rapidly putrefies. The next creature to touch the corpse within 1 minute per level of the target's death causes the corpse to explode in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half).
