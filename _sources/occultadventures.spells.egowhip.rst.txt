Ego Whip I
===========

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [emotion, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  psychic 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will partial; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You can use your psychic power to overwhelm the target's ego, leaving the target feeling hopeless and unsure of itself. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The target takes a –2 penalty to that ability score, and is also staggered for the first round it's affected. A successful Will save negates the staggered effect and reduces the duration of the penalty to 1 round.
