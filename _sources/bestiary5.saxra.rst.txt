.. _`bestiary5.saxra#special_abilities`:

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Bone Swarm (Su)**\  Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of a saxra takes 5d6 points of slashing damage and 5d6 points of negative energy damage from the whirling cloud of bone shards that surrounds it. Before the bone swarm deals damage, it attempts a caster level check to dispel any :ref:`death ward <corerulebook.spells.deathward#death_ward>`\  effects on the target (as per a CL 20 :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  spell).

\ **Spawn Skeleton (Su**\ ) Any creature that dies within 60 feet of a saxra must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or rise as a skeleton (or skeletal champion if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or more) in 1d4 rounds. Creatures raised as skeletons are overcome with the desire to slay living creatures, but the saxra has no control over them. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Splintered Ground (Su)**\  As a standard action, a saxra can cause splintered bones to erupt from all terrain (except worked stone or open water) in a 100-foot radius. Any creature moving across this area takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of negative energy damage for every 5 feet of movement, and must succeed at a DC 30 Reflex save or have its land speed reduced by half for 10 minutes. The bones remain and continue to deal damage indefinitely unless someone removes them manually (taking 10 minutes of work for each 5-foot square) or the saxra uses this ability again. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This undead spirit of bones and wind makes its home high atop remote mountains. Legends claim that a saxra can call forth amazing insights from latent memories stored in the very bones that make up its form.

A saxra towers over 20 feet tall and weighs 2 tons.
