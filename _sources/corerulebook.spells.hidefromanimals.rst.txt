Hide from Animals
==================

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  druid 1, ranger 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  S, DF

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Targets**\  one creature touched/level

\ **Duration**\  10 min./level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as :ref:`blindsense <corerulebook.glossary#blindsight_and_blindsense>`\ , :ref:`blindsight <corerulebook.glossary#blindsight_and_blindsense>`\ , :ref:`scent <corerulebook.glossary#scent>`\ , and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.
