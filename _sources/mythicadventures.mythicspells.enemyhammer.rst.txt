Enemy Hammer
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`enemy hammer <advancedplayersguide.spells.enemyhammer#enemy_hammer>`

The target becomes entangled whether or not it succeeds at its saving throw. When using the target as a weapon, add half your tier to your attack roll, and add your tier to the damage roll.

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use the target to hit a creature, you can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver against that creature. Your CMB for this maneuver is equal to your attack bonus for \ *mythic enemy hammer*\ , except you add your tier instead of half your tier.
