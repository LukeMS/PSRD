Hold Portal
============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Component**\ V

\ **Range**\ medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A :ref:`knock <corerulebook.spells.knock#knock>`\  spell or a successful :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  spell can negate a \ *hold portal*\ spell.

Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.
