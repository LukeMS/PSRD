Special Abilities
==================

\ **Adamantine Weapons (Ex)**\  The teeth and claws of a clockwork dragon are made of adamantine and have the qualities of a weapon made from that material.

\ **Efficient Winding (Ex)**\  Built for long and dangerous missions, a clockwork dragon can function for 3 days per Hit Die each time it's wound.

\ **Self-Destruction (Ex)**\  When a clockwork dragon's hit points are reduced to 10% of its total (17 in the case of most clockwork dragons) or less but are still above 0, the creature self-destructs on its next turn, bursting into an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 10d6 points of slashing damage plus 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Charisma-based.

While the clockwork goliaths possess more brute power, clockwork dragons' powerful breath weapons and mastery of flight make them more versatile and graceful killers. Designed for long flights and missions, the intricate winding mechanism of the clockwork dragon is more efficient than that of other clockwork constructs, partially because it reuses some of the energy generated by its intricate wings and the complex machinery of its breath weapon device. One of the most complicated and subtly crafted clockworks, its many moving parts are fortified by adamantine supports and fixtures, making this killing machine a brilliant mix of intricacy and unyielding terror.

The basic chassis and internal workings of the clockwork dragons are highly adaptable, and many variants of the clockwork dragon exist. Clockwork dragons are typically 20 feet long from snout to the tip of its tail, and weigh nearly 75 tons.

.. _`bestiary4.clockwork#variant_clockwork_dragons`:

Variant Clockwork Dragons
**************************

The following are a number of variant clockwork dragons. Some clockwork dragons exhibit more than one of these variations.

\ **Acid Breath (CR +0)**\ : Equipped with an internal fountain of caustic liquid, this type of clockwork dragon replaces its fire breath with a 60-foot line of acid. Targeted creatures take 10d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 22 half).

\ **Destroyer (CR + 0)**\ : These clockwork dragons are used as highly mobile and powerful siege engines. While the destroyer clockwork dragon lacks a breath weapon, as a full-round action taken while on solid ground, it can move its gears to pull its wings apart and to rise up as a heavy bombard. The body of the clockwork is used as the platform for the bombard, and the internal workings of the clockwork can load the bombard without a crew, though it still takes five full-round actions on the part of the clockwork to load the bombard. The clockwork dragon can also take the actions necessary to aim the bombard. A clockwork dragon carries enough ammunition to fire the bombard 10 times.

\ **Flaming Tar Breath (CR +1)**\ : Instead of breathing fire, some clockwork dragons spray a 30-foot cone of flaming tar. Creatures in the area of effect take 14d6 points of fire damage and are entangled in a thick layer of flaming tar. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled effect. Creatures are entangled for 5 rounds as the tar burns. Entangled creatures take 3d6 points of fire damage each round on their turn. Spending a full-round action and succeeding at a DC 22 Reflex save removes the tar, freeing the trapped creature from the entanglement and further fire damage.

\ **Infiltrator (CR + 1)**\ : These clockwork dragons are more subtle and nimble than those of other clockwork dragons. An infiltrator clockwork dragon can rearrange its movable parts into very serpentine and compact shapes, which gives it the compression ability. Furthermore, its parts are coated with a black, noise-dampening resin, granting it a +8 racial bonus on :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks (typically :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  +0). Finally, it's infused with magic allowing it, as a standard action, to become invisible as the :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`\  spell (CL 15th) three times per day. The infiltrator clockwork dragon's invisibility is a supernatural ability.

\ **Mithral (CR +0)**\ : This variant loses its adamantine weapons and its DR, which are replaced by greater flight capability thanks to its spell-infused mithral parts. Its land and swim speeds increase to 70 feet, and its fly speed increases to 200 feet with good maneuverability. In addition, once per day as a swift action, it can gain the benefits of the :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\  spell for 1d4 rounds.

\ **Rust Breath (CR +0)**\ : Rust-breath clockwork dragons do not breathe fire. Instead, the creatures breathe out a fine mist of an alchemical solvent that instantly rusts exposed metals. This so-called "rust breath" issues forth in a 60-foot line. Creatures can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid the effect for attended items; however, they need to make a separate attempt for each exposed item. Each alchemical dragon can hold enough of the alchemical solvent to make up to three breath weapon attacks before the solvent must be refilled manually, which takes 10 minutes. These clockwork dragons are made of ironwood, adamantine, and other resistant materials immune to rusting of any form.

\ **Sleep Gas Breath (CR +0)**\ : This clockwork dragon's breath weapon is replaced with tanks of sleep gas. When the clockwork breathes out this gas in a 30-foot cone, creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 22 Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+10 rounds. Clockwork dragons with this breath weapon tend to have either the infiltrator or mithral variants, and often they have both variants. These clockwork dragons excel at missions that require stealth and precision rather than brute force.

These constructs are the pinnacle of clockwork inventions. An ingenious combination of mechanical devices and magical conduits allows a clockwork mage to channel the power of a wand into a variety of arcane powers. They often serve powerful arcane spellcasters, or as unflinching and unquestioning casters to those who wants the benefit of spells without ego or free thought.

A humanoid figure of mithral and steel, a clockwork mage has large crystal ball filled with shifting vapors for a head. It stands 7 feet tall.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Powerful Kick (Ex)**\  As a standard action, the clockwork steed can make two hoof attacks with its rear hooves; if both hit, it can perform an awesome blow combat maneuver as the :ref:`Awesome Blow <bestiary.monsterfeats#awesome_blow>`\  feat. A clockwork steed gains a +4 racial bonus on this combat maneuver check.

These tireless constructs were designed by engineers as a replacement for normal horses. They can gallop ceaselessly for hours or even days if required. In addition to their endurance, clockwork steeds pack a powerful physical punch—blows from their hooves can send smaller creatures flying. Though many riders enjoy the unquestioning way that clockwork steeds accept commands from their riders, others find these steeds' lack of personality frustrating. Unlike normal horses, a clockwork steed lacks the ability to create a bond with its rider.

Clockwork Charger
******************

Clockwork chargers are constructed to wreak greater mechanized terror on the battlefield. A clockwork charger has the advanced simple template and is specially equipped for enhancing mounted charges or making such charges even without a rider by way of its pivoted lance.

A clockwork charger has a pivoted latch large enough to support a lance and allows even those who are not proficient with a lance to use it as if they were. Furthermore, the clockwork charger is proficient with any lance equipped in the pivot and gains the undersized weapon special ability.
