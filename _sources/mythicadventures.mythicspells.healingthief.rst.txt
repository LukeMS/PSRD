Healing Thief
==============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`healing thief <ultimatecombat.spells.healingthief#healing_thief>`

Instead of stealing half the target's healing, you steal all of it. The amount of damage you steal before the spell is discharged increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points).

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range of the spell changes to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). If the target has fast healing or regeneration, you steal half of its fast healing or regeneration. Healing from these abilities count toward the maximum healing stolen before the spell is discharged.
