\ *Pyrotechnics*\ turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

\ *Fireworks*\ : The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become :ref:`blinded <corerulebook.glossary#blinded>`\  for 1d4+1 rounds (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. :ref:`Spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  can prevent blindness.

\ *Smoke Cloud*\ : A stream of smoke billows out from the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even :ref:`darkvision <corerulebook.glossary#darkvision>`\ , is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take â€“4 penalties to :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  and :ref:`Dexterity <corerulebook.gettingstarted#dexterity>`\  (:ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. :ref:`Spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  does not apply.
