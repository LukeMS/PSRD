Special Abilities
==================

\ **Faith-Bound (Su)**\  A juggernaut cannot attack any creature that openly wears or displays the holy symbol or unholy symbol of the deity to which the juggernaut is dedicated unless that creature first attacks the juggernaut.

\ **Shrine (Ex)**\  A juggernaut counts as a movable shrine for the deity or religion it is dedicated to.

\ **Soul-Powered (Su)**\  When a juggernaut kills a creature with at least 5 Hit Dice and an alignment two or more steps away from the juggernaut's alignment, it gains a kill point. Add its current total kill points as a bonus on its attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, caster level checks, and skill checks. Add half its current total kill points as a bonus to its natural armor and spell resistance. The juggernaut loses 1 kill point every 24 hours.

\ **Vicious Trample (Ex)**\  A juggernaut's massive rollers deal 8d6+38 points of damage on a successful trample attack.

Juggernauts protect locations dedicated to a particular faith, their massive forms infused with divine energy that animates them and infuses them with their deity's power. Some faiths use a juggernaut as a mobile shrine, anointing it with sacred materials and offering prayers to the divine.

.. _`bestiary4.juggernaut#keyed_domains`:

Keyed Domains
**************

A juggernaut gain special abilities from two domains granted by the deity to which the juggernaut is dedicated. If an ability requires a saving throw, the save DC is Wisdom-based (DC 19 for most juggernauts). The caster level is equal to the juggernaut's Hit Dice (CL 15th for most juggernauts).

The sample juggernaut is keyed to the domains of Death and War—a juggernaut dedicated to some other deity has abilities based on that deity's domains.

\ **Destruction**\ : \ *Destructive Aura (Su)*\ —The juggernaut can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for 10 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in the aura (including the juggernaut) gain a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls and all critical threats are automatically confirmed.

\ **Earth**\ : \ *Tremorsense (Su)*\ —The juggernaut gains tremorsense 60 feet.

\ **Evil**\ : \ *Evil Attacks (Su)*\ —The juggernaut's slam and vicious trample attacks are treated as evil-aligned. Its vicious trample deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to good targets.
