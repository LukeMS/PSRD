Special Abilities
==================

\ **Tongue (Ex)**\ A giant frog's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the frog's normal reach (15 feet for a Medium giant frog). A giant frog's tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab. A giant frog does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.

Giant frogs have razor-sharp teeth lining their mouths. They are 6 feet long and weigh 200 pounds.

Poisonous frogs are a bright green color, with additional bright yellow, red, or blue markings. They are just over a foot long and weigh 10 pounds. The poison of poisonous frogs is often gathered by primitive tribes and used to coat darts and arrows for hunting.

You can make a larger poison frog either by applying the giant simple template or by giving a normal giant frog a poison frog's venomous bite.
