Adhesive Spittle
=================

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  alchemist 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  15 ft.

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level or until discharged (see text)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Reflex partial; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

Once during this spell's duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell's DC rather than a tanglefoot bag's normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.
