Special Abilities
==================

\ **Art is Life (Ex)**\  A muse is the master of all forms of art; she counts Craft and Perform as single skills and all Knowledge skills as class skills. She can use versatile performance as a bard for all categories of Perform. A muse's blindsight is sound-based.

\ **Inspiration (Su)**\  A muse can inspire art and passion in her targets, as per a :ref:`nymph's <bestiary.nymph>`\  inspiration. The muse has a constant \ *status*\  spell cast on the creatures she is inspiring, and can project her senses to one of them, or teleport to a location within 100 feet of one of them, as a standard action. She can inspire a number of creatures equal to her Charisma bonus.

\ **Muse's Ward (Su)**\  A muse incorporates solid music into her jewelry and clothing, granting her (but not others) a +4 armor bonus to AC and allowing her to add half her Charisma bonus to her Constitution bonus when calculating hit points. The notes also act as masterwork instruments for all types of Perform.

\ **Unearthly Grace (Su)**\  A muse adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on saves, and as a deflection bonus to AC.

Muses are the fey incarnation of inspiration, rousing poets, musicians, and artists to greater works of beauty.
