You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The \ *explosive runes*\ detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the \ *explosive runes*\ (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the \ *explosive runes*\ is entitled to a :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  save for half damage. The object on which the \ *explosive runes*\ were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the \ *explosive runes.*\ Likewise, you can remove the \ *explosive runes*\ whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  or \ *erase*\ spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the \ *explosive runes*\ and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

Magic traps such as \ *explosive runes*\ are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart \ *explosive runes*\ . The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for \ *explosive runes*\ .
