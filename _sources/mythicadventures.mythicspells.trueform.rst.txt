True Form
==========

\ **Source**\  :ref:`true form <advancedplayersguide.spells.trueform#true_form>`

The spell's target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to :ref:`change shape <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#change_shape>`\  between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes. To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  check to know the creature has the ability to take that form.

\ **Augmented (6th)**\ : If you expend three uses of mythic power, the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures. The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.
