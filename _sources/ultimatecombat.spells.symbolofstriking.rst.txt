Symbol of Striking
===================

\ **School**\ illusion (shadow); \ **Level**\ cleric 5, magus 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a masterwork melee weapon costing at least 300 gp)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will half, see text; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes, see text

 This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that using the material component, you scribe a :ref:`symbol of striking <ultimatecombat.spells.symbolofstriking#symbol_of_striking>`\  so it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered, the :ref:`symbol of striking <ultimatecombat.spells.symbolofstriking#symbol_of_striking>`\  glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks. 

The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol\ *.*\  However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creature's spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit.

\ *Symbol of striking*\  can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.
