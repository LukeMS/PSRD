You create a massive rampart of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet thick. The :ref:`rampart <advancedplayersguide.spells.rampart#rampart>`\  cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the :ref:`rampart <advancedplayersguide.spells.rampart#rampart>`\  has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the :ref:`rampart <advancedplayersguide.spells.rampart#rampart>`\  whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the :ref:`rampart <advancedplayersguide.spells.rampart#rampart>`\  with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the :ref:`rampart <advancedplayersguide.spells.rampart#rampart>`\  with a DC 20 :ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  check.
