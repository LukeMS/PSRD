Druid
******

Druids are devotees of nature, protecting the bleakest deserts and most verdant forests. Through their kinship with animals and the elements, they learn the most potent secrets the natural world has to offer, and can call upon great power in the form of both magical abilities like wild shape and a wide array of thematic spells. Whether tapping the fundamental magic of the elements or relying on the teeth and claws of wild creatures to accomplish their goals, druids are forces to be reckoned with, and those whose actions threaten the wild places these nature folk hold dear had best be prepared to suffer the consequences.

The following section details new animal and terrain domains for druids, vermin companions for druids who don't want a more traditional animal companion, and new druid archetypes.

Animal and Terrain Domains
###########################

Presented in the section below are new rules for animal and terrain domains—domains for druids whose focus is more specific than the Animal, Plant, Weather, or elemental domains. A druid with the nature's bond ability can choose an animal domain or terrain domain. Just like cleric domains, animal and terrain domains have granted powers and domain spells, and a druid who selects an animal or terrain domain gains a domain spell slot at each level. A druid who worships a deity (as opposed to nature in general) cannot select an animal or terrain domain that contradicts or is outside of the portfolio of her deity.

If an animal or terrain domain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's druid level + her Wisdom modifier.

Other nature-themed classes with access to domains may select an animal or terrain domain in place of a regular domain.

Vermin Companions
##################

In addition to the normal choices of animal companions, a druid who is so inclined may select a vermin as her companion. Vermin companions follow the same rules as animal companions, advancing their Hit Dice and other abilities per the :ref:`animal companion base statistics table <corerulebook.classes.druid#table_3_8_animal_companion_base_statistics>`\ . Vermin companions can be trained as if they were animals using the :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  skill.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#mindless`:

\ **Mindless**\ : Vermin companions have no Intelligence score and possess the mindless trait. In spite of this, vermin companions may learn one trick, plus additional bonus tricks. If a vermin animal companion gains an ability score increase (at 4 Hit Dice, 8 Hit Dice, and so on), the druid can apply this increase to the companion's Intelligence, changing it from — to 1, at which point the companion loses the mindless quality and is able to know up to 3 tricks per point of Intelligence, plus the additional bonus tricks. Vermin companions have no skill points or feats as long as they have the mindless quality.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#trip`:

\ **Trip**\ : Because many vermin have multiple limbs, they are very difficult to trip. As a result, a CMD entry has been included for each, indicating the bonus to CMD such vermin receive against trip attacks.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#dragon_shaman_(archetype)`:

Dragon Shaman (Archetype)
##########################

Your totem is the legendary dragon, fearsome and deadly yet cunning and wise, a creature born of pure magic and raw elemental fury, bound within a shell of fangs, claws, and scales that few dare to challenge. Though your initial focus is on dragons' mundane cousins, as your powers grow you become attuned to actual dragons.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#nature_bond`:

\ **Nature Bond**\ : A dragon shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a crocodile or monitor lizard. If choosing a domain, the dragon shaman must choose from the Air, Animal, Destruction, Earth, Fire, War, and Water domains.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#wild_empathy`:

\ **Wild Empathy (Ex)**\ : A dragon shaman can use her wild empathy ability with lizards as a full-round action with a +4 bonus. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#totem_transformation`:

\ **Totem Transformation (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, a dragon shaman may adopt an aspect of the dragon while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [average], the druid must be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial bonus to :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\ ), toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, :ref:`Endurance <corerulebook.feats#endurance>`\  feat), or natural weapons (bite [1d6] and 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium shaman, +2 bonus on CMB on grapple checks). While using totem transformation, the dragon shaman may speak normally and can cast :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\  (lizards only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The dragon shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#totemic_summons`:

\ **Totemic Summons (Su)**\ : At 5th level, a dragon shaman may cast \ *summon nature's ally*\  as a standard action when summoning lizards, and summoned lizards gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any lizard to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#wild_shape`:

\ **Wild Shape (Su)**\ : At 6th level, a dragon shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level – 4. If she takes on the form of a lizard, she instead uses her unmodified druid level.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#dragon_bite`:

\ **Dragon Bite (Su)**\ : At 8th level, a dragon shaman's bite attack (whether using totem transformation or wild shape to take the form of a lizard) deals +1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). She chooses what kind of energy damage that she deals each time she bites. This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 8th level.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#bonus_feat`:

\ **Bonus Feat**\ : At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a dragon shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: :ref:`Combat Casting <corerulebook.feats#combat_casting>`\ , :ref:`Dazzling Display <corerulebook.feats#dazzling_display>`\ , :ref:`Magical Aptitude <corerulebook.feats#magical_aptitude>`\ , :ref:`Skill Focus <corerulebook.feats#skill_focus>`\  (:ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  [arcana]), and :ref:`Spell Penetration <corerulebook.feats#spell_penetration>`\ . She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#menhir_savant_(archetype)`:

Menhir Savant (Archetype)
##########################

Some druids study the paths of nature's power through the nodes and ley lines that connect standing stones and megalithic circles, learning to tap into their energies.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#spirit_sense`:

\ **Spirit Sense (Sp)**\ : At 1st level, a menhir savant can detect the presence of undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures. This ability functions like :ref:`detect undead <corerulebook.spells.detectundead#detect_undead>`\ , and the druid detects all of these creatures rather than trying to detect one kind. This ability replaces nature sense and wild empathy.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#place_magic`:

\ **Place Magic (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, a menhir savant learns to identify and tap into ley lines in different types of terrain. As a free action, she can tap into the magic of a nearby ley line and increase her caster level by +1 for 1 round. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom bonus. This ability replaces woodland stride and trackless step.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#walk_the_lines`:

\ **Walk the Lines (Su)**\ : At 9th level, a menhir savant can use her connection to ley lines to cast :ref:`transport via plants <corerulebook.spells.transportviaplants#transport_via_plants>`\  a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#empty_body`:

\ **Empty Body (Su)**\ : At 13th level, a menhir savant can become ethereal as a standard action, as if using :ref:`ethereal jaunt <corerulebook.spells.etherealjaunt#ethereal_jaunt>`\ . She can remain ethereal for a number of rounds per day equal to her druid level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability replaces a thousand faces. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#mooncaller_(archetype)`:

Mooncaller (Archetype)
#######################

A mooncaller is bound to the subtle influences of the ever-changing moon and its endless cycles from light to dark and back again. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#night_sight`:

\ **Night Sight (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a mooncaller gains low-light vision. If she already has low-light vision, she gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision is increased by 30 feet. This ability replaces woodland stride. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#resist_call_of_the_wild`:

\ **Resist Call of the Wild (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, a mooncaller gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid confusion, daze, feeblemind, and insanity effects. She also gains a +4 bonus against the exceptional, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of creatures with the shapechanger subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#purity_of_body`:

\ **Purity of Body (Ex)**\ : At 9th level, a mooncaller gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases. This ability replaces venom immunity. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#wolfsbane`:

\ **Wolfsbane (Su)**\ : At 13th level, a mooncaller gains DR 3/silver, increasing to DR 4/silver at 16th level and DR 5/silver at 19th level. This ability replaces a thousand faces. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#pack_lord_(archetype)`:

Pack Lord (Archetype)
######################

Some druids bond with many animal companions rather than just one, achieving a level of communion rare even in druidic circles and leading their pack brothers and pack sisters with total authority.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#pack_bond`:

\ **Pack Bond (Ex)**\ : A pack lord druid may not select a domain and must choose an animal companion. The druid gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  checks made regarding her animal companion. The pack lord may have more than one animal companion, but she must divide up her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a 4th-level pack lord can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion.

Each time a pack lord's druid level increases, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once a druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the pack lord's service (she must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can do the next time she prepares spells). The share spells animal companion ability only applies to one animal companion at a time—the pack lord cannot use it to cast a one-target spell and have it affect all of her animal companions. This ability replaces nature bond.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#improved_empathic_link`:

\ **Improved Empathic Link (Su)**\ : The pack lord gains an empathic link with all of her animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar. In addition, as a swift action the pack lord can shift her perception to one of her companions, allowing her to experience what it sees, hears, and so on. She can maintain this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and end it as a free action. The druid can only use this ability on one companion at a time, and cannot see, hear, or smell with her own body while maintaining this connection. This ability replaces the 6th-level additional use of wild shape.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#reincarnated_druid_(archetype)`:

Reincarnated Druid (Archetype)
###############################

Spun off into the endless circle of life, an incarnate druid is an embodiment of nature's eternal renewal. She lives many lives and wanders the world devoid of attachments, a stranger to all yet one with all life.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#mysterious_stranger`:

\ **Mysterious Stranger (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a reincarnated druids adds 1/2 her druid level to the DC of :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\ , :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , and :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  checks to learn about her. This ability replaces woodland stride.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#resist_deaths_touch`:

\ **Resist Death's Touch (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, a reincarnated druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and necromancy effects, and on stabilization checks when dying. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#many_lives`:

\ **Many Lives (Ex)**\ : At 5th level, if a reincarnated druid is killed, she may automatically :ref:`reincarnate <corerulebook.spells.reincarnate#reincarnate>`\  (as the spell) 1 day later. The reincarnated druid appears in a safe location within 1 mile of her previous body. At will for the next 7 days, she can sense the presence of her remains as if using :ref:`locate object <corerulebook.spells.locateobject#locate_object>`\  as a spell-like ability. If she is killed during these 7 days, she remains dead and does not reincarnate. The many lives ability does not function ifthe reincarnated druid is slain by a death effect. A reincarnated druid cannot be raised from the dead or resurrected, though she can be reincarnated.

\ **Wild Shape (Su)**\ : A reincarnated druid gains this ability at 6th level, and it functions at her druid level – 2.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#cheat_death`:

\ **Cheat Death (Ex)**\ : At 9th level, once per day, a reincarnated druid may reroll a save against a death effect, energy drain, or necromancy effect before the result of the roll is revealed, or reroll a failed stabilization check while dying. She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse than the original roll. This ability replaces venom immunity. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#tongue_of_the_sun_and_moon`:

\ **Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)**\ : At 15th level, a reincarnated druid can speak with any living creature. This ability replaces timeless body.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#saurian_shaman_(archetype)`:

Saurian Shaman (Archetype)
###########################

A shaman with this focus calls upon the primeval dinosaur, the archaic terror that lingers as a hungering, atavistic stranger at the fringes of the ecosystem, a destroyer and despoiler whose coming other animals dread. 

\ **Nature Bond**\ : A saurian shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a dinosaur. If choosing a domain, a saurian shaman must choose from the Animal, Destruction, Strength, and War domains.

\ **Wild Empathy (Ex)**\ : A saurian shaman can use wild empathy with dinosaurs and reptiles as a full-round action with a +4 bonus. 

\ **Totem Transformation (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, a saurian shaman may adopt an aspect of the saurian while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the dragon shaman's totem transformation ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (+10 enhancement bonus to land speed), scales (+2 natural armor bonus to AC), senses (low-light vision, scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d6], 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium druid, rake, +2 CMB to grapple). While using totem transformation, a saurian shaman may speak normally and can cast :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\  (reptiles and dinosaurs only) at will. 

\ **Totemic Summons (Su)**\ : At 5th level, a saurian shaman may cast \ *summon nature's ally*\  as a standard action when summoning reptiles and dinosaurs, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the dragon shaman's totemic summons ability. 

\ **Wild Shape (Su)**\ : At 6th level, a saurian shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level –2. If she takes on the form of a reptile or a dinosaur, she instead uses her druid level +2.

\ **Bonus Feat**\ : At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a saurian shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: :ref:`Improved Overrun <corerulebook.feats#improved_overrun>`\ , :ref:`Nimble Moves <corerulebook.feats#nimble_moves>`\ , :ref:`Power Attack <corerulebook.feats#power_attack>`\ , :ref:`Skill Focus <corerulebook.feats#skill_focus>`\  (:ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\ ), or :ref:`Vital Strike <corerulebook.feats#vital_strike>`\ . She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#shark_shaman_(archetype)`:

Shark Shaman (Archetype)
#########################

Some druids emulate the deadly shark, a remorseless hunter that marine dwellers dread. Like a true shark, a shark shaman leaves blood and fear in her wake. 

\ **Nature Bond**\ : A shark shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a shark. If choosing a domain, a shark shaman may choose the Animal, Death, War, or Water domain.

\ **Wild Empathy (Ex)**\ : A shark shaman can use wild empathy with fish as a full-round action with a +4 bonus. 

\ **Totem Transformation (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, a shark shaman may adopt an aspect of the shark while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the dragon shaman's totem transformation ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (can breathe water, swim speed 30 feet), senses (scent 30 feet, scent 90 feet in water), natural weapons (bite 1d6 for a Medium shaman), or shark skin (+2 natural armor, creatures grappling the shaman take 1 point of slashing damage per round of grapple). While using totem transformation, the shark shaman may speak normally and can cast :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\  (fish only) at will. 

\ **Totemic Summons (Su)**\ : At 5th level, a shark shaman may use \ *summon nature's ally I*\  to summon a stingray and \ *summon nature's ally II*\  to summon a manta ray. She may cast \ *summon nature's ally*\  as a standard action when summoning rays and sharks, and summond rays and sharks gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the dragon shaman's totemic summons ability.

\ **Wild Shape (Su)**\ : At 6th level, a shark shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level –2. If she takes on the form of a shark, she instead uses her druid level +2. 

\ **Bonus Feat**\ : At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a shark shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: :ref:`Bleeding Critical <corerulebook.feats#bleeding_critical>`\ , :ref:`Improved Initiative <corerulebook.feats#improved_initiative>`\ , :ref:`Lightning Reflexes <corerulebook.feats#lightning_reflexes>`\ , :ref:`Self-Sufficient <corerulebook.feats#self_sufficient>`\ , or :ref:`Skill Focus <corerulebook.feats#skill_focus>`\  (:ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\ ).

While most druids focus their attention upon the rich earth and the bounty of nature that springs forth from it, the storm druid's eyes have ever been cast to the skies and the endless expanse of blue, channeling the most raw and untamed aspects of nature.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.druid#spontaneous_domain_casting`:
