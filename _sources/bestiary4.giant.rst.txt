Special Abilities
==================

\ **Earth Attunement (Su)**\  A cliff giant has tremorsense 30 feet when standing on unworked stone or natural earth. :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (nature) is a class skill for cliff giants.

Cliff giants are benevolent but reclusive creatures that dwell in deserts and badlands, carving out snug cliffside caves or building stone huts on top of mesas. Broad-shouldered, with features as sharp as chiseled stone, cliff giants can reach a height of 14 feet and weigh over 1,300 pounds. As if sculpted from layers of stone, cliff giants' skin color is a deep reddish brown, with quartz-like streaks or veins of color that crisscross in shades of ivory, dull yellow, or bright white. Cliff giants live up to 800 years old.

Although kind, cliff giants prefer solitude and spend their lives in seclusion from other humanoids to form a stronger bond with the natural world. This bond often leads them to see large expanses of land as their responsibility and all living things within as their charges. Many track cycles of the weather, animal migrations, and the lairs of dangerous monsters by painting elaborate pictograms on high cliff walls.

Cliff giant family units stay together for about a decade, after which time children live with one parent or the other until fully grown and able to survive on their own (at about 20 years old). Marital bonds between cliff giants are strong despite their inclination for solitude; a married pair of cliff giants may raise and bear children in this way once every century, and when living apart they communicate with each other on a monthly basis using animal messengers.

Cliff giants respect their elders, and some pairs living together are an adult giant with an old parent or grandparent.

If the conch is destroyed (hardness 5, 20 hp), the giant can spend 1 week to craft a replacement.

Ocean giants embody the great extremes of the sea. Their skin colors vary from deep blue to pale green, and their eyes and hair range from foamy white to coral pink. They decorate themselves with the treasures of the sea, wearing shell jewelry or scrimshaw, and clothing woven from underwater plants, or even salvaged sails. Each ocean giant carries a hand-crafted musical horn made from a conch shell, an object of cultural significance representing its family history and travels on the vast sea.

Many ocean giants view themselves as guardians of the sea, its creatures, and those who travel the waves, safeguarding their charges from remarkable coral towers. Others, however, claim domains measuring thousands of leagues, enslaving the beasts and aquatic races within and shattering any ship that dares trespass near their citadels of urchins and bones.

Adult ocean giants stand approximately 22 feet tall and weigh about 15,000 pounds. Most live to be about 500 years old.

River giants traverse inland waterways, moving where the current takes them on their makeshift rafts. Tall but lean and lithe, river giants typically grow to a height of 10 feet and weigh about 900 pounds. River giants have skin color that ranges from the yellowish green of algae or duckweed to the rich jade of a bamboo stalk. Their hair color is much less varied, usually a sooty black or muddy brown color. River giants can live to be 300 years old.

River giants are as likely to be evil as they are good, though all members of a family usually have the same alignment. Whether kind or cruel, all river giants are quick to anger and capable of erupting with little or no cause. Among their own kind, arguments usually result in one or both participants getting pushed into the water to cool off. Good river giants typically switch between bouts of great, jovial laughter or physical comedy (such as nearly tipping a raft with passengers), followed by quiet introspection while listening to the sounds of a slow river. Evil river giants often see themselves as the embodiment of a river's most chaotic elements, like waterfalls, rapids, or ice floes; they might hold someone underwater for a minute or two as a bit of fun, and they take no more responsibility for their violence than the river itself would.

River giants love water travel, and they can often be hired to ferry travelers across or along a waterway for a price. Shrewd though not overly intelligent, river giants usually base such transport fees on the estimated wealth of their passengers—typically 100 gp each for adventurers.

In combat, river giants prefer to attack from the water whenever possible, or keep opponents in deep water where the giants' bigger lungs are an advantage. If they are losing a fight, they swim underwater to escape or use their rafts as cover.

River giants prefer to lair on small islands, rock formations, or sediment banks where rivers come together. A river giant uses its home, usually a simple earthen hut of mud and reeds, to store its valuables or as a place to gather with others of its kind.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Shattering Blow (Ex)**\  A slag giant who makes a full attack against a metal or stone object or structure deals double damage.

Magically crafted and crossbred from fire giants and stone giants by ancient wizards, slag giants are among the foremost artisans and crafters of giantkind. Proportioned more like stone giants than fire giants, slag giants have long limbs with lean muscles; they stand 14 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds. Slag giants' skin color ranges from a deep and ruddy hue to a rusty orange. Their hair is black, gray, or white, though males and females both tend to keep their hair cropped close or shaved off. Slag giants can live to be 400 years old.

Slag giants usually evince a cold, detached attitude about everything other than their work. Their inherent understanding of metalworking and resistance to fire allow them to craft arms and armor from inside their huge forges, sometimes working the metal with their bare hands. Small families of slag giants often ally with clans of other giants, providing masterwork armor and weapons in exchange for ore and the freedom to practice their crafting skills in peace. Even militaristic fire giants (who pride themselves on their strength and martial prowess) respect the fine work of the weaker slag giants, and usually attempt to ally with the artisans rather than enslaving them.

Slag giant settlements usually consist of several stone homes (built from or surrounded by forge slag) with built-in forges and large, smoking chimneys. Most are in hills or mountains, but they can be found anywhere there is a ready supply of iron ore. Although they prefer creation to combat, slag giants are brutal and efficient fighters, capable of destroying an enemy's weapons or armor in a few precise blows. They often let opponents retreat if it gives the giants the opportunity to collect any broken weapons and armor as salvage. If approached peacefully, they are willing to barter or sell their goods, though they usually don't have human-sized items on hand. Trespassers who carelessly or wantonly destroy a slag giant's work or foul its forge usually end up in the fire. Most settlements have several giant-sized breastplates the residents can don if they expect a serious fight.
