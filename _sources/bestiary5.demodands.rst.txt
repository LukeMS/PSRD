Special Abilities
==================

\ **Sacrilegious Spittle (Ex)**\  As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a gristly demodand can spit acidic mucus in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 15d6 points of acid damage (DC 27 Reflex half), and are entangled on a failed save. Entangled creatures take 5d6 points of acid damage each round at the end of their turns. Creatures that take acid damage from sacrilegious spittle are also subject to the demodand's faith-stealing strike. Each round on its turn, an entangled creature may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Gristly demodands delight in inflicting pain and suffering, eagerly fulfilling their roles in demodand culture as assassins, executioners, and torturers. These fiends conduct special missions of reconnaissance, disruption, and violent destruction, frequently leading crack units of tarry demodands into hostile lands, where they attack key demonic installations in order to subject their captives to brutal and insidious torture for the purpose of extracting information.

A gristly demodand's skin is stretched so taut over rolls of fat and cartilaginous flesh that it continually rips and splits, though a yellow-white mucus that oozes out from within heals these superficial tears, keeping its body intact.

A typical gristly demodand is 7 feet tall and weighs up to 600 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Entangling Folds (Ex)**\  Although the disgusting growths on a stringy demodand are technically part of its skin, the demodand has a small measure of control over these ropy appendages. As a swift action, a stringy demodand can use its growths to entangle any adjacent creatures of its size or smaller. To resist being entangled, a target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save. As long as the stringy demodand is entangling one or more creatures, any creature that moves adjacent to the demodand must successfully save or likewise be entangled. Entangled creatures can't move farther than 5 feet from the stringy demodand until they break free from its growths. An entangled creature can break free as a move action by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength or Escape Artist check. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Stringy demodands fulfill their duty to their titan masters as kidnappers and slave masters throughout the Abyssal realms. Stringy demodands' agility allows them to quickly :ref:`Snatch <bestiary.monsterfeats#snatch>`\  up targets and prevent slave revolts before they start.

The stringy demodands' long, obsidian-colored skin growths give the abhorrent outsiders their name. These fibers resemble nothing so much as elongated skin tags the girth of a human finger and are roughly 4 feet in length. The fibrous outgrowths sprout from their heads and the tips of their wings. These ropy feelers bob and sway wildly as a stringy demodand moves, creating a truly disturbing image for those victims who glimpse back at their Abyssal pursuer.

Because these rubbery strands cover most of the creatures' bodies, they provide a measure of natural protection that allows stringy demodands to eschew armor. Stringy demodands are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds.
