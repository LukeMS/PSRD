Talismanic Implement
=====================

\ **School**\  evocation; \ **Level**\  occultist 3

\ **Casting Time**\  10 minutes

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level (D) or until discharged

This spell functions as :ref:`contingency <corerulebook.spells.contingency>`\ , but you invest a spell whose level doesn't exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell's school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person. Casting \ *talismanic implement*\  reduces the selected implement's mental focus by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects of resonant powers. When you refresh your mental focus, \ *talismanic implement*\  ends automatically, even if the duration hasn't elapsed. Unlike :ref:`contingency <corerulebook.spells.contingency>`\ , you may have multiple \ *talismanic implements*\  simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only one \ *talismanic implement*\  spell, and if you have any \ *talismanic implements*\ , you can't have any other kind of :ref:`contingency <corerulebook.spells.contingency>`\  in effect.
