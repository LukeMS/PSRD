Dimensional Lock
=================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`dimensional lock <corerulebook.spells.dimensionallock#dimensional_lock>`

The spell doesn't interfere with your extradimensional travel spells and effects.

\ **Augmented (4th)**\ : You can augment \ *mythic dimensional lock*\  to redirect teleporting creatures to another location. If you expend two uses of mythic power, designate a location that you're very familiar with. This location must be on the same plane as you. Any creature attempting to use extradimensional travel from outside the spell's area into that area is instead redirected to this other location.

The creature can attempt a :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  check against your caster level. If it succeeds, it's aware of the redirection (though not the destination) and can interrupt its spellcasting, losing the spell but not teleporting.
