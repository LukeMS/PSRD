Halt Undead
============

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

\ **Range**\ medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Targets**\  up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (see text); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of :ref:`hold person <corerulebook.spells.holdperson#hold_person>`\  on a living creature). The effect is broken if the \ *halted*\ creatures are attacked or take damage.
