Teleport Object
================

\ **School**\  conjuration (teleportation); \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 7

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu. ft./level

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (object); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (object)

This spell functions like :ref:`teleport <corerulebook.spells.teleport#teleport>`\ , except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
