Displacement
=============

\ **School**\  illusion (glamer); \ **Level**\  bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, M (a small loop of leather)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, \ *displacement*\ does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. :ref:`True seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\  reveals its true location and negates the miss chance.
