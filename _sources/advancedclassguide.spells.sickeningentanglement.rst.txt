Sickening Entanglement
=======================

\ **School**\  transmutation [poison]; \ **Level**\  druid 2, ranger 2, shaman 2

\ **Saving Throw**\  Reflex partial and Fortitude negates (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

This spell functions as \ *entangle*\ , except the plants are coated with an irritating sap that creates a painful, itching rash on creatures that touch them. Any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. This is a poison effect.
