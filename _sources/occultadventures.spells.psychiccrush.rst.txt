Psychic Crush I
================

\ **School**\  necromancy [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  psychic 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will partial and Fortitude partial; see text; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

Using your psychic power, you invade the mind of the target and tear it asunder, causing massive internal damage to both its mind and body. If the target succeeds at the initial Will save, it is sickened for 1 round. If the target fails its Will save, it must attempt a Fortitude save (with a +4 circumstance bonus on this save if it has more than half its total hit points remaining). If it also fails the Fortitude save, the target is reduced to –1 hit points and is dying. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level, which cannot reduce the target below –1 hit point, and the target is sickened for 1 round. This attack has no effect on creatures without an Intelligence score.

\ **School**\  necromancy [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  psychic 7

This functions as \ *psychic crush I*\ , but the target takes 7d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Fortitude save and 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Will save.

Psychic Crush IV
=================

\ **School**\  necromancy [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  psychic 8

This functions as \ *psychic crush I*\ , but the target takes 9d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Fortitude or Will save. The target does not receive any saving throw bonus because of its hit points. If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, it doesn't gain a Fortitude save to resist this spell but instead proceeds as if it had automatically failed its Fortitude save.
