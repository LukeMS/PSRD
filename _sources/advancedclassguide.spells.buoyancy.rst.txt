Buoyancy
=========

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  bard 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 immediate action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  one Medium or smaller object or creature/level, no two of which can be more than 20 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  up to 1 round/level (see text)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (object)

The affected targets become incredibly buoyant, floating naturally on any water at least 1 foot deep. An affected creature that deliberately tries to submerge must succeed at a DC 20 :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  check every round to stay underwater. If a target spends at least 1 round on dry land, the spell ends for that creature only.
