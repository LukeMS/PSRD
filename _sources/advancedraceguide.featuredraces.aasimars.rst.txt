Aasimars
#########

Aasimars are humans with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. While not always benevolent, aasimars are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil, and they gravitate toward faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimars take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. "It's always the one you least suspect" is the axiom these evil aasimars live by, and they often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule.

\ **Physical Description**\ : Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin color, or even glowing, golden halos.

\ **Society**\ : Aasimars cannot truly be said to have an independent society of their own. As an offshoot of humanity, they adopt the societal norms around them, though most find themselves drawn to those elements of society that work for the redress of injustice and the assuagement of suffering. This sometimes puts them on the wrong side of the law in more tyrannical societies, but aasimars can be careful and cunning when necessary, able to put on a dissembling guise to divert the attention of oppressors elsewhere. While corrupt aasimars may be loners or may establish secret societies to conceal their involvement in crime, righteous aasimars are often found congregating in numbers as part of good-aligned organizations, especially (though not always) churches and religious orders. 

\ **Relations**\ : Aasimars are most common and most comfortable in human communities. This is especially true of those whose lineage is more distant and who bear only faint marks of their heavenly ancestry. It is unclear why the touch of the celestial is felt so much more strongly in humanity than other races, though it may be that humanity's inherent adaptability and affinity for change is responsible for the evolution of aasimars as a distinct race. Perhaps the endemic racial traits of other races are too deeply bred, too strongly present, and too resistant to change. Whatever dalliances other races may have had with the denizens of the upper planes, the progeny of such couplings are vanishingly rare and have never bred true. 

However, even if they generally tend toward human societies, aasimars can become comfortable in virtually any environment. They have an easy social grace and are disarmingly personable. They get on well with half-elves, who share a similar not-quite-human marginal status, though their relations are often less cordial with half-orcs, who have no patience for aasimars' overly pretty words and faces. Elven courtiers sometimes dismiss aasimars as unsophisticated, and criticize them for relying on natural charm to overcome faux pas. Perhaps of all the known races, gnomes find aasimars most fascinating, and have an intense appreciation for their varied appearances as well as the mystique surrounding their celestial heritage. 

\ **Alignment and Religion**\ : Aasimars are most often of good alignment, though this isn't necessarily universal, and aasimars that have turned their back on righteousness may fall into an unfathomable abyss of depravity. For the most part, however, aasimars favor deities of honor, valor, protection, healing, and refuge, or simple and prosaic faiths of home, community, and family. Some also follow the paths of art, music, and lore, finding truth and wisdom in beauty and learning.

\ **Adventurers**\ : Aasimars frequently become adventurers, as they often do not quite feel at home in human society and feel the pull of some greater destiny. Clerics, oracles, and paladins are most plentiful in their ranks, though bards, sorcerers, and summoners are not uncommon among those with a fondness for arcane magic. Aasimar barbarians are rare, but when born into such tribes they often rise to leadership and encourage their clans to embrace celestial totems.

\ **Male Names**\ : Aritian, Beltin, Cernan, Cronwier, Eran, Ilamin, Maudril, Okrin, Parant, Tural, Wyran, Zaigan.

\ **Female Names**\ : Arken, Arsinoe, Davina, Drinma, Imesah, Masozi, Nijena, Niramour, Ondrea, Rhialla, Valtyra.

Description
============

This bright silver or gold +2 :ref:`blinding <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_blinding>`\  heavy steel :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\  is impossibly light and handy despite its size. It has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance, and it allows the wielder to use :ref:`feather fall <corerulebook.spells.featherfall#feather_fall>`\  on himself once per day. A creature wearing \ *celestial armor*\ while wielding a celestial :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\  may command the armor to provide :ref:`overland flight <corerulebook.spells.overlandflight#overland_flight>`\  rather than :ref:`fly <corerulebook.spells.fly>`\  once per day.

Aasimar Spells
***************

Aasimars have access to the following spells.

.. _`advancedraceguide.featuredraces.aasimars#sacred_space`:

Sacred Space
=============

\ **School**\  evocation [good]; \ **Level**\  cleric 2, paladin 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a vial of ambrosia)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Area**\ 20-ft.-radius emanation

\ **Duration**\  2 hours/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

This spell sanctifies an area with heavenly power. The DC to resist spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or channeled energy that damages evil outsiders (as when using :ref:`Alignment Channel <corerulebook.feats#alignment_channel>`\ ) increases by +2. In addition, evil outsiders take a –1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and they cannot be called or summoned into a \ *sacred space*\ . If the \ *sacred space*\ contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or good-aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled. You cannot cast \ *sacred space*\ in an area with a permanent fixture dedicated to a deity other than yours.

.. _`advancedraceguide.featuredraces.aasimars#truespeak`:

Truespeak
==========

\ **School**\  divination; \ **Level**\  bard 4, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\ you

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level

You can communicate with any creature that is not mindless. As long as you can be heard, your speech is understandable to all creatures, each of which hears you as though you were conversing in its language or other natural mode of communication, and you hear their responses as though in your own native language. You may ask questions and receive answers, though this spell does not make creatures more friendly or cooperative than normal, and non-sentient creatures may give limited responses. While using \ *truespeak,*\ your language-dependent effects can affect any creature that is not mindless. 

.. _`advancedraceguide.featuredraces.aasimars#veil_of_heaven`:

Veil of Heaven
===============

\ **School**\  abjuration [good]; \ **Level**\  paladin 1

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 standard action

\ **Components**\ V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  personal or 5 ft.; see text

\ **Target**\ you or all creatures within 5 ft.; see text

\ **Duration**\  10 minutes/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will half; \ **Spell Resistance**\  none

You surround yourself with a veil of positive energy, making it harder for evil outsiders to harm you. For the duration of this spell, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only against attacks or effects created by outsiders with the evil subtype. You can dismiss this spell as a swift action to deal 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per paladin level to all such outsiders within 5 feet. A Will save halves this damage.
