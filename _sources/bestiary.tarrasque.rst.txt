Special Abilities
==================

\ **Carapace (Su)**\  The tarrasque's scales deflect cones, lines, rays, and :ref:`magic missile <corerulebook.spells.magicmissile#magic_missile>`\  spells, rendering the tarrasque immune to such effects. There is a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise it is simply negated.

\ **Powerful Leaper (Ex)**\  The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks made to jump, and has a +24 racial bonus on :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks made to jump.

\ **Regeneration (Ex)**\  No form of attack can suppress the tarrasque's regeneration—it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If the tarrasque fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is inflicted upon its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but the method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.

\ **Rush (Ex)**\  Once per minute for 1 round, the tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. This increases its :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  bonus on checks made to jump to +87.

\ **Spines (Ex)**\  The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an attack roll for each spine—all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.

The legendary tarrasque is among the world's most destructive monsters. Thankfully, it spends most of its time in a deep torpor in an unknown cavern in a remote corner of the world—yet when it wakens, kingdoms die.

Although far from intelligent, the tarrasque is smart enough to understand a few words in Aklo (though it cannot speak). Likewise, it isn't mindless in its rampages, but instead focuses on targets that threaten it, and is difficult to distract with trickery.
