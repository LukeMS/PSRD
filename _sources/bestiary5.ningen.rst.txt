Special Abilities
==================

\ **Polar Breach (Su)**\  As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a ningen can rapidly submerge itself beneath the water and then launch itself upward to break the surface and crash down. The impact produces flying chunks of ice dealing 10d6 points of cold damage and 10d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures and objects within a 30-foot radius. Creatures that take cold damage are staggered and entangled for a number of rounds equal to the ningen's Hit Dice, and those that take piercing damage are sickened for the same number of rounds. A successful DC 27 Reflex save halves this damage and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Colossal but reclusive, ningens inhabit the coldest oceans of the world, preying on fish and large arctic mammals like walruses and even whales. A ningen has long armlike flippers ending in sharp spurs that act as claws, and a humongous tail that can propel it rapidly through the water. The creature's body is sheathed in layers of thick, insulating blubber. Its face is oddly featureless, with nothing more than a pair of small nostrils, two large, black eyes, and a thin mouth containing rows of large teeth.

Although intelligent and capable of communication, ningens are distrustful of humanoids, particularly those on seafaring vessels, due to a long history of their kind being hunted by land dwellers. While the insulating blubber that allows ningens to exist in the coldest waters has some of the same uses as whale oil, a ningen's supernatural link to cold makes its bones, its skin, and even its teeth valuable to those seeking to craft or enchant various magic items.

When threatened or angered, ningens make terrifying opponents. Ningens always attempt to bring enemies into the water, where they can use their abilities to greater effect.

A ningen is 90 feet long and weighs 180,000 pounds.
