An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies.

This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.
