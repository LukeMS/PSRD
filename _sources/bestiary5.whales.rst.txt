Special Abilities
==================

\ **Hold Breath (Ex)**\  A blue whale can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 10 times its Constitution score.

\ **Stun (Ex)**\  A blue whale's fluke can deliver a powerful stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. If the strike is a critical hit and the target fails its save, it is also stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.

\ **Tail Slap (Ex)**\  A blue whale's tail slap is a primary attack and applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on damage rolls.

Despite their size, blue whales are docile unless threatened. They eat millions of tiny invertebrates known as krill, which they suck through their baleen in massive gulps. These enormous mammals can be found in oceans and seas. An adult blue whale is 100 feet long and weighs 200 tons.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Hold Breath (Ex)**\  Narwhals are expert deep divers, and a narwhal can hold its breath a number of minutes equal to 2 times its Constitution score.

\ **Tusk (Ex)**\  A charging narwhal can make a single gore attack with its tusk in place of its normal bite attack. If it hits, the tusk deals 2d6+14 points of damage with a Ã3 critical multiplier.

Narwhals are skilled hunters in arctic waters, and are known to dive deeper than even much larger cetaceans both in open water and beneath thick sheets of floating ice. A male narwhal possesses a single, 6-foot-long tusk extending from just above its mouth, which it uses to impress females during mating season, engaging in flashy duels with other males. In times of need, the tusks may be used to break through thick ice or even in self-defense, though most narwhals prefer to flee rather than fight. A typical narwhal is about 14 feet long (not including the tusk) and weighs 3,200 pounds.
