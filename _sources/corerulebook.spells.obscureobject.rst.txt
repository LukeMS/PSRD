Obscure Object
===============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  bard 1, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (chameleon skin)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one object touched of up to 100 lbs./level

\ **Duration**\  8 hours (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (object); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (object)

This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the :ref:`scrying <corerulebook.spells.scrying#scrying>`\  spell or a \ *crystal ball*\ . Such an attempt automatically fails (if the divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person).
