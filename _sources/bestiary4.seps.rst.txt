Special Abilities
==================

\ **Acid Blood (Ex)**\  A metal, wooden, or natural weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage to a seps takes 4d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save at the listed DC. The DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Liquefaction (Su)**\  Any creature killed by seps poison dissolves into an acidic liquid that deals 2d6 points of acid damage per round to anything in its square (including the dead creature's equipment).

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  Bite—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 22; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 10 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d8 acid damage and 1d4 Con drain; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.

A seps is an exotic snake-like creature whose powerful jaws contain acidic venom so potent that it quickly dissolves prey into liquid.

An adult seps is 30 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.
