Temporary Resurrection
=======================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

\ **Casting Time**\  10 minutes

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (diamond dust worth 500 gp)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  dead creature touched

\ **Duration**\  24 hours

You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with :ref:`raise dead <corerulebook.spells.raisedead#raise_dead>`\ ). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast :ref:`raise dead <corerulebook.spells.raisedead#raise_dead>`\  or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with \ *temporary resurrection*\ , this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
