Weapon Special Abilities
#########################

A magic weapon is enhanced to strike more truly and deliver more damage. Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonuses on attack rolls do not stack with their enhancement bonuses on attack rolls.

Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonuses apply to both melee and ranged attacks.

Some magic weapons have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. Weapons cannot possess the same special ability more than once.

Weapons or ammunition can be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

\ **Caster Level for Weapons**\ : The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

\ **Additional Damage Dice**\ : Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.

\ **Ranged Weapons and Ammunition**\ : The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon.

\ **Light Generation**\ : Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell. These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. They can't be concealed when drawn, nor can their light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

\ **Hardness and Hit Points**\ : Each +1 of a magic weapon's enhancement bonus adds +2 to its hardness and +10 to its hit points. 

\ **Activation**\ : Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by wielding (attacking with) it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action). A character can activate the special abilities of 50 pieces of ammunition at the same time, assuming each piece has identical abilities.

\ **Magic Weapons and Critical Hits**\ : Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect also functions against creatures not normally subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.

\ **Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures**\ : The cost of weapons for creatures that are neither Small nor Medium varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

\ **Special Qualities**\ : Roll d%. A 01–30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31–45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 46–100 indicates no special qualities.

This movement does not count against her ability to move or take a 5-foot step earlier or later in the round, though using this ability imposes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. This ability may not be used in conjunction with any other ability or effect that allows moving as part of an attack.

This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon or a thrown weapon. An \ *anchoring*\ weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from moving. As a swift action, the weapon can be fixed in place in a point in space, functioning as an :ref:`immovable rod <corerulebook.magicitems.rods#immovable_rod>`\ . This ability can also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using an \ *anchoring*\  weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon, preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check as a full-round action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An \ *anchoring*\ weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to attack while it is anchoring a creature. An \ *anchoring*\ weapon has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and creatures in gaseous or liquid form.

A \ *conductive*\  weapon is able to channel the energy of a spell-like or supernatural ability that relies on a melee or ranged touch attack to hit its target (such as from a cleric's domain granted power, sorcerer's bloodline power, oracle's mystery revelation, or wizard's arcane school power). When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel it through the weapon to the struck opponent, which suffers the effects of both the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has unlimited uses of a special ability, she may channel through the weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her \ *conductive greatsword*\  can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands.

\ **Price**\  +2 bonus; \ **Aura**\  strong evocation; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  —

A \ *flaming burst*\  weapon functions as a \ *flaming*\  weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the \ *flaming*\  ability (see above), a \ *flaming burst*\  weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage.

Even if the \ *flaming*\  ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A furious weapon serves as a focus for its wielder's anger. When the wielder is raging or under the effect of a rage spell, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than normal. If the wielder has a rage power that gives a skill bonus while raging (such as raging climber, raging leaper, or raging swimmer), the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill whenever the weapon is wielded or held in her hand, even when she is not raging. This bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon (and also includes the +2 if the wielder is raging).

This flame lasts for 1 round for every d6 of damage or healing the channeling normally provides. When charged with positive energy, the flame is a silvery gray, good creatures are immune to the weapon's extra damage, and the weapon counts as a good and silver weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A \ *guardian*\ weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to his saving throws as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon. The bonus on saving throws lasts until his next turn. Only the weapon's own enhancement bonus can be sacrificed, not any enhancement bonus provided by other effects such as a :ref:`greater magic weapon <corerulebook.spells.magicweapon#magic_weapon_greater>`\  spell. However, the total of such effects is still diminished by the amount allocated to improving saving throws.

If the creature has a component to its damage reduction other than the alignment types listed above, that component is unaffected. Thus, if the \ *+1 negating lance*\ above hits a demon with DR 10/good and cold iron, it would leave the demon with DR 10/cold iron and 5/good for 1 round. The effects of multiple \ *negating*\ weapons (or multiple hits from the same weapon) do not stack. This ability can only be placed on melee weapons.

A \ *spell storing*\  weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled \ *spell storing*\  weapon has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it already.

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A \ *spellstealing*\ weapon allows its wielder to siphon protective magic from a target and transfer it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a target, she can forgo confirming the critical hit and instead automatically learn which spells or magical effects are active upon the target. The wielder may then make a caster level check to steal her choice of one of those effects, using the \ *spellstealing*\  weapon's caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target immediately loses the benefits of that effect and the wielder gains the effect for 1 minute (or until the effect expires, whichever comes first). If the \ *spellstealing*\ weapon has a critical multiplier greater than ×2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell effect per additional multiple beyond ×2 (two effects for ×3, and so on).

The longer the wielder of a \ *stalking*\  weapon studies a target, the more effective her strike. As a standard action, a character wielding a \ *stalking*\  weapon can command it to study a creature within 60 feet. The wielder must have line of effect and line of sight to that target. When the wielder attacks the studied creature, on a successful hit the \ *stalking*\  weapon deals +1d6 points of bonus damage per consecutive round spent studying a target, up to a number of bonus dice equal to the \ *stalking*\  weapon's enhancement bonus. This bonus damage is precision damage and only applies to the first successful hit against that creature.

If the wielder attacks a creature other than the studied creature, commands the weapon to study a different creature, or ends her turn more than 60 feet from the studied creature, the weapon loses all bonus damage dice against the previously studied creature.

===============

\ **Price**\  +10,000 gp; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation; \ **CL**\  10th; \ **Weight**\  —

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A \ *transformative*\  weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium \ *transformative longsword*\  can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small \ *transformative greatsword*\  can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the –2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a \ *keen transformative*\  weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the \ *keen*\  special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon.
