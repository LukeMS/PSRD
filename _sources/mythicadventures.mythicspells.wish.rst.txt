Wish
=====

\ **Source**\  :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`

When using \ *mythic wish*\  to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.

You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the non-mythic :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  spell description:

* If you use \ *mythic wish*\  to remove injuries and afflictions, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power to remove that number of additional afflictions from all affected creatures.

* If you use \ *mythic wish*\  to revive the dead, you can expend a second use of mythic power to negate the target's permanent negative level from the :ref:`resurrection <corerulebook.spells.resurrection#resurrection>`\ .

* Alter fate. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can cast \ *mythic wish*\  as an immediate action before a 1d20 roll is attempted and choose what number you want to come up on the die.

\ **Augmented**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled \ *mythic wish*\ , even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
