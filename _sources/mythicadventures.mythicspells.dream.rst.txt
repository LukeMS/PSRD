Dream
======

\ **Source**\  :ref:`dream <corerulebook.spells.dream#dream>`

You or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using :ref:`speak with dead <corerulebook.spells.speakwithdead#speak_with_dead>`\  to speak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resist this probing with a Will save (as \ *speak with dead*\ , using the DC :ref:`dream <corerulebook.spells.dream#dream>`\  would have if it allowed a saving throw). Answers to these questions are still generally brief and cryptic.
