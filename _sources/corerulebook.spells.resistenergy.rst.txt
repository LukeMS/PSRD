Resist Energy
==============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  10 min./level

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the :ref:`energy resistance <corerulebook.glossary#energy_resistance>`\  granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.

\ *Resist energy*\ absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.

\ *Resist energy*\ overlaps (and does not stack with) :ref:`protection from energy <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromenergy#protection_from_energy>`\ . If a character is warded by :ref:`protection from energy <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromenergy#protection_from_energy>`\  and \ *resist energy,*\ the \ *protection*\ spell absorbs damage until its power is :ref:`exhausted <corerulebook.glossary#exhausted>`\ .
