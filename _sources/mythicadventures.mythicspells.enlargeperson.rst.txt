Enlarge Person
===============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`

You can increase the target's size by up to two size categories, to a maximum of Huge. If the target grows two sizes, its weight increases by a factor of 25, it gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, and takes a –4 size penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC because of its increased size. A Medium humanoid creature whose size increases to Huge has a space of 15 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. \ *Mythic enlarge person*\  counters and dispels :ref:`mythic reduce person <mythicadventures.mythicspells.reduceperson>`\ .
