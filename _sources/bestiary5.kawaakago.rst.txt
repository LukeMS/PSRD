Special Abilities
==================

\ **Blood-Burning Fangs (Ex)**\  A kawa akago's spiny fangs on both its outside and central maws are covered with nettles capable of inflicting wracking pain. On a successful bite attack, a target is sickened for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Multiple failed saves do not increase the penalty, but instead reset the effect's duration. Immersion in water or a similar liquid for 2 full rounds negates the effect. Despite feeling like fire, the effect is not reduced or negated by fire resistance or immunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Wail of the Water's Dead (Su)**\  Once per day as a standard action, a kawa akago can unleash a keening wail that leaves a damaging and disruptive echo in the ears of those that hear it. All creatures and objects in a 20-foot radius take 2d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the sonic damage and reduces the deafness to 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Kawa akagos are plants that were spiritually fertilized by fragments of the restless spirits of drowned children, becoming carnivorous creatures that inhabit marshes and riversides. They resemble lily pads with a mouthlike opening guarded by fibrous strands like those of a flytrap plant. A kawa akago's gourdlike skin ranges from maroon to crimson when it is well fed, but more often, creatures encounter a kawa akago when it is hungry. In this case, it instead takes on the same hue as other lilypads in the area, usually an innocuous green.

Carnivorous and cunning, kawa akagos hunt riverbanks and waterways for both animals and travelers on which to feed. Kawa akagos' thorn-tipped fangs excrete a pain-inducing sap that mimics the feeling of intense, burning heat. Though they prefer to fight in water, kawa akagos usually ambush from land, using their dangerous sap to drive would-be prey toward the nearby rivers or streams that will soothe the painful effects of their fangs. Once the victim immerses itself, the plant creatures swarm their target if attacking in numbers, or a single plant strikes from the depths to wear down the victim. Although a kawa akago has no respiratory system, it's body is rife with pockets it can fill with air and expel as necessary. This network of hollow chambers allows the creature to speak on the rare occasions it wishes to communicate, and is the source of the creature's terrible wail, which is capable of breaking bones and shattering glass. The sound is often described as similar to the simultaneous mournful cries of a dozen children in serious distress.

Blood Lily
***********

While ordinary kawa akagos feed on any prey that pass by, some kawa akagos that remain engorged with the blood and flesh of sentient creatures for a long period of time become blood lilies. Blood lilies are much larger and are red at all times. They crave the blood of sentient creatures above all other food, and their alignment changes to neutral evil. They gain the advanced and giant simple templates as well as the psychic magic ability, with spells that vary but generally include magic that can lure their desired prey into their waiting maws.

Particularly tenacious blood lilies that continue to feed on sentient creatures may evolve further, gaining greater powers and even class levels. Fortunately, most blood lilies overstep themselves before that point and are destroyed by prey that proves too much for the plants to handle.
