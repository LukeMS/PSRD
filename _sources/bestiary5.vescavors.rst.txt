Special Abilities
==================

\ **Chaos Aura (Su)**\  A vescavor queen is an embodiment of chaos. Its aura is a font of anarchic energy that grants fast healing 2 to the vescavor queen, as well as to any vescavor swarm within 10 feet of the queen. A vescavor queen can activate or suppress this ability as a free action.

\ **Gibber (Su)**\  Like their broods, vescavor queens yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor queen must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can't be affected by the same vescavor queen's gibbering for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Spit Acid (Ex)**\  As a standard action, a vescavor queen can make a ranged touch attack to spit acid at a foe within 30 feet. A target hit by this glob of acid takes 5d6 points of acid damage. In addition, the spit of a vescavor queen contains some of its pheromones. Any target that takes damage from this attack acts as a beacon for vescavor swarms; the damaged creature takes a -8 penalty on Stealth checks against the vescavor queen and swarms it controls, and likely becomes the swarm's next target.

\ **Swarm Mother (Su)**\  A vescavor queen can mentally control up to 20 Hit Dice of vescavor swarms through a combination of pheromones and supernatural manipulation. To control a vescavor swarm, the vescavor queen must be able to see it and must be within 120 feet of it. Attempting to control a vescavor swarm is a standard action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the vescavor queen can issue a simple mental command as a swift action, such as "fight," "come here," "go there," or "stay still." Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act normally unless a vescavor queen is actively controlling them, but never attack the vescavor queen. The save DC is Charisma-based. In addition, whether or not it controls the swarm, a vescavor queen is immune to a vescavor swarm's swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities. A vescavor queen can release a vescavor swarm from its control as a free action. If a vescavor queen is killed, any vescavor swarms under its control disperse.

Appearing as an amalgam of twisted, unnatural insects, a vescavor queen is a hideous sight to behold, even among the terrifying denizens of the Abyss. Not only is a queen's bite stronger than that of its spawn, but the queen can also spit acid at opponents, and its arms end in scything claws poised to rend through flesh and armor. Vescavor swarms instinctively obey a queen, eagerly seeking out those foes marked by the queen's attacks. A vescavor queen measures roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and weighs nearly 500 pounds— more when carrying a brood.

With a gibbering chorus, hundreds of toothy insects swarm together, their heads nothing more than maws filled with a sickly green glow.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Gibber (Su)**\  Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Ravenous (Ex)**\  Vescavors can devour nearly anything. If the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature—if the vescavor swarm is not under the control of a vescavor queen, refer to :ref:`Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks <corerulebook.magic#table_9_2_items_affected_by_magical_attacks>`\ . Once the vescavors choose an item in this way, they continue to devour that same item until it is destroyed. The object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Traumatizing (Su)**\  Enduring the presence of a vescavor swarm is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that spends more than 3 consecutive rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain one of the :ref:`types of madness presented in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GameMastery Guide <gamemasteryguide.sanityandmadness#types_of_insanity>`\ . Roll on the :ref:`Types of Insanity table <gamemasteryguide.sanityandmadness#types_of_insanity>`\  to determine which type of insanity affects the creature. Despite each entry listing a DC, the creature does not receive an additional Will save to prevent the insanity. This affliction is permanent, but can be healed as detailed in the :ref:`Curing Insanity section <gamemasteryguide.sanityandmadness#curing_insanity>`\  of the :ref:`Sanity and Madness rules <gamemasteryguide.sanityandmadness>`\ . The save DC is Charisma-based.

Once found only in the lightless crevices and shrieking half-live jungles of the Abyss, the yammering, gluttonous vermin of the Abyss called vescavors crawl through portals into the Material Plane to feed and spawn. Ruled by enormous, hideous queens who direct their swarms in finding food and destroying foes with the help of pheromones and mental commands, vescavor swarms devour objects, creatures, and structures alike. Their hunger is insatiable and carries with it the terrors of the Abyss itself, warping the minds of even those creatures who escape the vescavors' maws. Only adamantine can endure their gnashing teeth, and a swarm of vescavors that descends upon a settlement devours everything and leaves nothing behind.
