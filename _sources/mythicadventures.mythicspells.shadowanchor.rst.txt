Shadow Anchor
==============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`shadow anchor <advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.wayangs#shadow_anchor>`

Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast :ref:`shadow walk <corerulebook.spells.shadowwalk#shadow_walk>`\  (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using :ref:`shadow walk <corerulebook.spells.shadowwalk#shadow_walk>`\ , this aspect of the spell has no effect).
