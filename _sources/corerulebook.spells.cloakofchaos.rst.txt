Cloak of Chaos
===============

\ **School**\  abjuration [chaotic]; \ **Level**\  cleric 8

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

\ **Range**\  20 ft.

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become :ref:`confused <corerulebook.glossary#confused>`\ . This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike :ref:`protection from law <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromlaw#protection_from_law>`\ , the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence, just as :ref:`protection from law <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromlaw#protection_from_law>`\  does.

Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is :ref:`confused <corerulebook.glossary#confused>`\  for 1 round (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save negates, as with the :ref:`confusion <corerulebook.spells.confusion#confusion>`\  spell, but against the save DC of \ *cloak of chaos*\ ).
