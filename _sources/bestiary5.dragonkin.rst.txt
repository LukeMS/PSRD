Special Abilities
==================

\ **Rider Bond (Su)**\  A dragonkin can form a magical bond with its rider that lasts until death. Forming this bond requires a special ritual that takes 1 hour. Once a dragonkin forms this bond, it can't form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its bonded rider can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy with a range of 100 feet. When a rider is mounted on his dragonkin at the start of combat, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest result as their single result.

Somewhere between true dragons and brute drakes lie the dragonkin. Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well with humanoids. Unlike many other dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to hold and wield weapons, and favor huge glaives and long lances.

The most unusual aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin recognize other cultures' potential, and often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they seem to be one entity. The humanoid riders are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions when they are not engaged in battle, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude.

Many dragonkin adopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor. This, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, disgusts some true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds.
