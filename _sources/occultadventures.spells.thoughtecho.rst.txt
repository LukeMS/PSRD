Thought Echo
=============

\ **School**\  illusion (glamer); \ **Level**\  mesmerist 1, psychic 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 round

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  living creature touched

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

When you cast this spell, you establish a mental echo of up to 25 words. Any attempt to read the surface thoughts of the target creature reads only this mental echo unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your caster level). If you cast \ *thought echo*\  on yourself, the DC is instead equal to 15 + your caster level. In addition, when casting this spell upon yourself, you can change the echoed thoughts by taking a standard action and concentrating.

Each time you change the words echoed by the spell in this way, you reduce the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. \ *Thought echo*\  does not interfere with telepathy or mind reading effects that are capable of reaching thoughts deeper than surface thoughts.
