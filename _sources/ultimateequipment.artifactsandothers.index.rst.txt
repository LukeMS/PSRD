Artifacts and Other Items
##########################

Why settle for generic magic items any caster can craft? This section covers rare and precious items with histories spun into legends, such as the monkey's paw, the philosopher's stone, and the deck of many things. Yet not every artifact or magic item is the boon it first appears to beâthis section also presents a wide array of cursed items that a crooked shopkeeper (or devious GM) might pass off to player characters as priceless wonders. Finally, those treasures that talk back: intelligent items. This last section includes the rules for creating and using such items, dedicated powers, personality quirks, and of course a wide selection of specific intelligent items ready to be dropped in players' paths.
