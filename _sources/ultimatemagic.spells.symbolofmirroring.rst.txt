Symbol of Mirroring
====================

\ **School**\  illusion (figment); \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorous, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 100 gp)

This spell functions as :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as :ref:`mirror image <corerulebook.spells.mirrorimage#mirror_image>`\ , moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

\ *Symbol of mirroring*\  can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.
