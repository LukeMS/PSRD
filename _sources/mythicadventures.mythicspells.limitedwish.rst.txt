Limited Wish
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`limited wish <corerulebook.spells.limitedwish#limited_wish>`

When using \ *mythic limited wish*\  to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.

\ **Augmented**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled \ *mythic limited wish*\ , even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
