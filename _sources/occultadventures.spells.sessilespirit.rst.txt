Sessile Spirit
===============

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  cleric 5, inquisitor 4, medium 2, occultist 3, shaman 4, spiritualist 3, witch 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one creature or object (see text)

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You reach into the target creature and cause that spirits within to become dormant and inactive. If the target is a medium with a spirit inhabiting its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its consciousness (or a member of another class using the spirit or phantom class features), a failed save renders that spirit or phantom powerless, suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom normally provides to its host, including bonus feats and spells known.

If a spirit within the target is a creature using a possession effect, including :ref:`possess object <ultimatemagic.spells.possessobject>`\ , :ref:`possession <occultadventures.spells.possession>`\ , or a ghost's malevolence, the spell targets the possessing creature rather than the creature it inhabits. On a failed save, the possessing spirit isn't exorcised from the target but is dazed for the duration of the spell.
