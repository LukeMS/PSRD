Animal Purpose Training
========================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  antipaladin 1, bard 2, druid 2, inquisitor 1, paladin 1, ranger 1, shaman 2, witch 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 minute

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a swatch of black cloth)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one indifferent or friendly animal

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You instill the target animal with a general purpose (see the :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  skill), which can be any purpose except combat trainingâ€”fighting, guarding, heavy labor, hunting, performance, or riding. This purpose supersedes the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the spell ends, the animal reverts to its previous trained purpose and known tricks.
