Symbol of Persuasion
=====================

\ **School**\  enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates

This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that all creatures within the radius of a \ *symbol of persuasion*\ instead become charmed by the caster (as the :ref:`charm monster <corerulebook.spells.charmmonster#charm_monster>`\  spell) for 1 hour per caster level.

Unlike :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , \ *symbol of persuasion*\ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \ *symbol of persuasion*\ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

\ *Note*\ : Magic traps such as \ *symbol of persuasion*\ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for \ *symbol of persuasion*\ .
