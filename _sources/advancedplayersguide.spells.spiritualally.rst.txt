===============

\ **School**\  evocation [force]; \ **Level**\  cleric 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Effect**\  spiritual ally of force

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for :ref:`spiritual weapon <corerulebook.spells.spiritualweapon#spiritual_weapon>`\ ), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.

Each round after the first, you can move the :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ , :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\ , a \ *sphere of annihilation*\ , or a :ref:`rod of cancellation <corerulebook.magicitems.rods#rod_of_cancellation>`\  affects it. A :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\ 's AC against touch attacks is 10. 

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the :ref:`spiritual ally <advancedplayersguide.spells.spiritualally#spiritual_ally>`\  strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
