Armor Special Abilities
########################

Enchanted armor is one of the most important things an adventurer can acquire—for what good is wealth and power when a dragon claw rips through your breastplate?

In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

Armor is always created so that if the type of armor comes with a pair of boots, a helm, or a set of gauntlets, these pieces can be exchanged for other magic boots, helms, or gauntlets.

\ **Caster Level for Armor and Shields**\ : The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

\ **Shields**\ : Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a shield bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).

A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.

As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

\ **Activation**\ : Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields: by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).

\ **Armor for Unusual Creatures**\ : The cost of armor for non-humanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions
****************************************************

Most magic armor and shields have only enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

.. _`ultimateequipment.magicarmsandarmor.armorspecialabilities#adhesive`:

Adhesive
=========

\ **Price**\  +7,000 gp; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation; \ **CL**\  10th; \ **Weight**\  —

On command, the hands and feet of this armor's wearer become incredibly sticky, granting her a climb speed of 20 feet. The stickiness grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks made to disarm, grapple, reposition, steal, or trip when the wearer is using a natural weapon or unarmed strike to attempt the maneuver. The wearer can gain these benefits for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-round intervals. Ending the effect is a free action. \ *Adhesive*\  cannot be placed on armor with any version of the :ref:`slick <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_slick>`\  special ability.

.. _`ultimateequipment.magicarmsandarmor.armorspecialabilities#animated`:

Animated
=========

\ **Price**\  +2 Bonus; \ **Aura**\  strong transmutation; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  —

As a move action, an :ref:`animated <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_animated>`\  shield can be loosed to defend its wielder on its own. For the following 4 rounds, the shield grants its bonus to the one who loosed it and then drops. While animated, the shield provides its shield bonus and the bonuses from all of the other shield special abilities it possesses, but it cannot take actions on its own, such as those provided by the :ref:`bashing <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_bashing>`\  and :ref:`blinding <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_blinding>`\  abilities. It can, however, use special abilities that do not require an action to function, such as :ref:`arrow deflection <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_arrow_deflection>`\  and :ref:`reflecting <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_reflecting>`\ . While animated, a shield shares the same space as the activating character and accompanies the character who activated it, even if the character moves by magical means. A character with an :ref:`animated <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_animated>`\  shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it to end its animation as a free action. Once a shield has been retrieved, it cannot be animated again for at least 4 rounds. This special ability cannot be added to a tower shield.

Arrow Catching
===============

\ **Price**\  +1 bonus; \ **Aura**\  moderate abjuration; \ **CL**\  8th; \ **Weight**\  —

A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapon attacks to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted. Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's deflection bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.

Arrow Deflection
=================

\ **Price**\  +2 bonus; \ **Aura**\  faint abjuration; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  —

This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon (or piece of ammunition) has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or \ *acid arrows*\ , can't be deflected.

.. _`ultimateequipment.magicarmsandarmor.armorspecialabilities#balanced`:

Balanced
=========

\ **Price**\  +1 bonus; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  —

This armor pushes back against anything that threatens to knock its wearer to the ground. The wearer gains a +4 bonus to his Combat Maneuver Defense against combat maneuvers made to overrun or trip and on :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  check made to maintain balance. Dropping prone while wearing \ *balanced*\  armor is a move action instead of a free action. The \ *balanced*\  ability can be applied to light or medium armors, but not heavy armors or shields.

.. _`ultimateequipment.magicarmsandarmor.armorspecialabilities#bashing`:

Bashing
========

\ **Price**\  +1 bonus; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation; \ **CL**\  8th; \ **Weight**\  —

A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A :ref:`bashing <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_bashing>`\  shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, :ref:`bull's strength <corerulebook.spells.bullsstrength#bull_s_strength>`

.. _`ultimateequipment.magicarmsandarmor.armorspecialabilities#benevolent`:

Benevolent
===========

\ **Price**\  +2,000 gp; \ **Aura**\  faint enchantment; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  —

This suit of armor best serves a wearer who focuses on assisting and protecting his allies. \ *Benevolent*\  armor is usually decorated with motifs of prosperity, plenty, and generosity, such as helping hands, cornucopias, and flourishing plants. When the wearer of a suit of \ *benevolent*\  armor uses the aid another action to give an ally a bonus to AC against an opponent's next attack, he also adds the \ *benevolent*\  armor's enhancement bonus to the ally's AC.

Construction Requirements
==========================

Cost +1,000 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, :ref:`aid <corerulebook.spells.aid#aid>`

.. _`ultimateequipment.magicarmsandarmor.armorspecialabilities#bitter`:

Bitter
=======

\ **Price**\  +1 bonus; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  —

This armor exudes an exceptionally vile and bitter taste whenever something bites or swallows a creature that is wearing it.

A suit of armor or shield with this special ability hides living animals within its iconography to keep it safe. The wearer can speak a command word to magically store an animal to which he is bonded, such as an animal companion, a familiar, or mount. The stored animal appears as a symbol emblazoned upon the armor or shield, either one that mimics the appearance of the animal or that is more symbolic and abstract.

While stored, the animal is sleeping and provides the wearer no benefit (such as a familiar's skill bonus). The size of animal that can be stored depends on the type of armor or shield. A suit of light armor, medium armor, or a light shield or heavy shield can store one animal up to the wearer's size. A suit of heavy armor or a tower shield can store one animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the stored animal from the \ *hosteling*\  armor or shield. A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.

Because the stored animal is sleeping rather than in suspended animation (or even hibernating), it ages and gets hungry at the normal rate while stored. A \ *hosteling*\  armor or shield automatically releases a stored animal 24 hours after it was stored inside.

This armor special ability still works on bonded magical beasts that were once animals, but not outsiders, oozes, or other exotic companion creatures.
