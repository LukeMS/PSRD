Detect Thoughts
================

\ **School**\  divination [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, F/DF (a copper piece)

\ **Range**\  60 ft.

\ **Area**\  cone-shaped emanation

\ **Duration**\  concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  no

You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

\ *1st Round*\ : Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  scores of 1 or higher).

\ *2nd Round*\ : Number of thinking minds and the :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  score of each. If the highest :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  score), you are :ref:`stunned <corerulebook.glossary#stunned>`\  for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.

\ *3rd Round*\ : Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast \ *detect thoughts*\ again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (:ref:`Int <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts.

Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
