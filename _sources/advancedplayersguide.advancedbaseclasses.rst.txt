Base Classes
*************

While most common folk have shared ale with a fighter or perhaps even seen a wizard perform an awesome act of magic, these are not the only adventurers known to legends and history. The following character classes present new options for players and greater variety for a Game Master's cast of nonplayer characters.

Base Classes
#############

The six new base classes presented in this book are equivalent in power to the 11 core classes in the \ *PRD Core Rulebook*\ . Game Masters (also called GMs) are encouraged to allow players to choose freely from these classes and the other additional rules and options in this book, but each GM must make a personal decision about what is and isn't allowed in his campaign, and the relative prevalence of such character classes in his or her world.

Each new class presents interesting character themes and special abilities as follows.
