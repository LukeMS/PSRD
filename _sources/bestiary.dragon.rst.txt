Dragon
#######

True dragons are divided into two broad categories: chromatic and metallic. Chromatic dragons are almost universally evil, seeking only to slake their endless lust for food, treasure, and bloodshed. Metallic dragons are generally good and often protect the lands under their care.

Age Categories
###############

Many of a true dragon's abilities, attacks, and other statistics improve as a dragon grows older. These increases are divided into 12 age categories—as a dragon ages, its base statistics change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table.

\ **Age Category**\ : This is the age category's name.

\ **Age in Years**\ : This is the dragon's actual age.

\ **CR**\ : This column modifies the dragon's base CR.

\ **Size**\ : This shows how many size categories by which to increase the dragon's base size, depending on its age (from Tiny to Small, Small to Medium, and so on). A true dragon does not gain the standard increases to ability scores when it achieves a larger size—instead, true dragons gain ability score increases according to their age category, as indicated on the Dragon Ability Scores table.

\ **Hit Dice**\ : This shows how many additional Hit Dice a dragon gains over its base Hit Dice as it grows. Increases to Hit Dice grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks as well as increase the dragon's base attack bonus and base save bonuses. Dragons have skill ranks equal to 6 + their Intelligence modifier per Hit Die. A dragon's increases to ability scores for gaining Hit Dice are included in the total ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table).

\ **Natural Armor**\ : This shows by what amount the dragon's base natural armor bonus increases with each age category.

\ **Breath Weapon**\ : Each dragon has a breath weapon (see Combat) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon's breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a base breath weapon that deals 2d6 acid damage would deal 14d6 acid damage (due to the ×7 multiplier).

:ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly#fly>`\  Speed: A dragon's fly speed increases as indicated, according to its size.

\ **Bite**\ : This is a primary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (even though it has more than one attack). A dragon's bite attack has reach as if the creature were one size category larger (+10 feet for Colossal dragons).

\ **Claws**\ : These primary attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon's Strength bonus.

\ **Wings**\ : The dragon can slam foes with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks are secondary attacks that deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's Strength bonus.

\ **Tail Slap**\ : The dragon can slap one foe each round with its tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (this is an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).

\ **Crush (Ex)**\ : A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.

\ **Tail Sweep (Ex)**\ : This allows a Gargantuan or larger dragon to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).

.. _`bestiary.dragon#breath_weapon_dragon`:

\ **Breath Weapon (Su)**\ : Using a breath weapon is a standard action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds, even if it possesses more than one breath weapon. A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, whose areas vary with the dragon's size. If a breath weapon deals damage, those caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Con modifier. Saves against various breath weapons use the same DC; the type of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. A dragon can use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.

Additional Dragon Rules
************************

.. _`bestiary.dragon#dragon_senses`:

\ **Dragon Senses (Ex)**\ : Dragons have darkvision 120 ft. and blindsense 60 ft. They see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

\ **Frightful Presence (Ex)**\ : A dragon's frightful presence has a range equal to 30 feet × the dragon's age category, but otherwise functions as detailed in the :ref:`Universal Monster Rules <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#frightful_presence>`\ .

\ **Spells**\ : A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description. Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities**\ : A dragon's caster level for its spell-like abilities is equal to its total Hit Dice.

\ **Damage Reduction**\ : Dragons gain damage reduction as they age, as indicated on each dragon's specific entry. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\ **Immunities (Ex):**\  Every dragon is immune to sleep and paralysis. In addition, a dragon is immune to one or two additional forms of attack no matter what its age, as given in its description.

\ **Spell Resistance (Ex):**\  As dragons grow older, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the dragon descriptions. A dragon's SR is equal to 11 + its CR.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Acid Pool (Su)**\  An ancient or older black dragon can use its breath weapon to create an acid pool as a standard action. This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface.

\ **Acidic Bite (Su)**\ At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.

\ **Charm Reptiles**\  \ **(Sp)**\  A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a :ref:`mass charm monster <corerulebook.spells.charmmonster#charm_monster_mass>`\  spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.

\ **Corrupt Water**\  \ **(Sp)**\  Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.

\ **Speak with Reptiles (Sp)**\  A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\ , but only with reptilian animals.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile—:ref:`darkness <corerulebook.spells.darkness#darkness>`\  (radius 10 feet per age category); Old—:ref:`plant growth <corerulebook.spells.plantgrowth#plant_growth>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`insect plague <corerulebook.spells.insectplague#insect_plague>`\ .

\ **Swamp Stride (Ex)**\  A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.

\ **Water Breathing (Ex)**\  A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation. Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Desert Thirst (Su)**\  A blue dragon can cast :ref:`create water <corerulebook.spells.createwater#create_water>`\  at will (CL equals its HD). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Electricity Aura (Su)**\  An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.

\ **Mirage (Su)**\  An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as :ref:`project image <corerulebook.spells.projectimage#project_image>`\  but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.

\ **Sandstorm (Su)**\  As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties (\ *PRD Core Rulebook*\  431). This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a free action. 

\ **Sound Imitation (Ex)**\  A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\  check against a listener's :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A blue dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young—:ref:`ghost sound <corerulebook.spells.ghostsound#ghost_sound>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`minor image <corerulebook.spells.minorimage#minor_image>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`ventriloquism <corerulebook.spells.ventriloquism#ventriloquism>`\ ; Old—:ref:`hallucinatory terrain <corerulebook.spells.hallucinatoryterrain#hallucinatory_terrain>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`veil <corerulebook.spells.veil#veil>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`mirage arcana <corerulebook.spells.miragearcana#mirage_arcana>`\ .

\ **Storm Breath (Su)**\  An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as :ref:`call lightning storm <corerulebook.spells.calllightningstorm#call_lightning_storm>`\ , but the damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by an additional 1d6 rounds.

Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat, blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Awaken Treants**\  \ **(Su)**\  A great wyrm dragon can call on the forest itself to aid it, animating a number of trees to serve as treants to protect it. These treants can be called from any Huge or larger living tree. A green dragon can create a single treant as a standard action, up to a total of 4 treants per day. These treants remain animated for up to 1 hour, at which time they revert to being ordinary trees. 

\ **Camouflage (Ex)**\ An old or older green dragon can use :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment.

\ **Miasma (Su)**\  An ancient or older green dragon can use its breath weapon to create a cloud of acid as a standard action that deals damage to any creature inside it. The cloud moves with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet. When it's created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon, with a Reflex save for half damage. The number of damage dice rolled is halved each round until the result would be less than 1d6. Any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as that created by a :ref:`gust of wind <corerulebook.spells.gustofwind#gust_of_wind>`\ , disperses the cloud in 1 round.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A green dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young—:ref:`entangle <corerulebook.spells.entangle#entangle>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`charm person <corerulebook.spells.charmperson#charm_person>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\ ; Old—:ref:`plant growth <corerulebook.spells.plantgrowth#plant_growth>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`dominate person <corerulebook.spells.dominateperson#dominate_person>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`command plants <corerulebook.spells.commandplants#command_plants>`\ .

\ **Trackless Step**\  \ **(Ex)**\  An adult or older green dragon does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. A green dragon can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires.

\ **Water Breathing (Ex)**\  A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

\ **Woodland Stride (Ex)**\  A very young or older green dragon can move through any sort of foliage at full speed without taking damage or suffering impairment. Areas of foliage that have been magically manipulated affect it normally.

Green dragons dwell in the ancient forests of the world, prowling under towering canopies in search of prey. Of all the chromatic dragons, green dragons are perhaps the easiest to deal with diplomatically.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Fire Aura (Su)**\  An adult red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.

\ **Incinerate (Su)**\  A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through :ref:`true resurrection <corerulebook.spells.trueresurrection#true_resurrection>`\  or similar magic. 

\ **Manipulate Flames (Su)**\  An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.

\ **Melt Stone (Su)**\  An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.

\ **Smoke Vision (Ex)**\  A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by :ref:`pyrotechnics <corerulebook.spells.pyrotechnics#pyrotechnics>`\ ).

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A red dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Blizzard (Su)**\  An ancient white dragon can use its breath weapon to create a blizzard in the area around it as a standard action. This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does.

\ **Cold Aura (Su)**\  An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.

\ **Freezing Fog (Sp)**\  An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an :ref:`acid fog <corerulebook.spells.acidfog#acid_fog>`\  spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a :ref:`grease <corerulebook.spells.grease#grease>`\  spell. The dragon is immune to the :ref:`grease <corerulebook.spells.grease#grease>`\  effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.

\ **Ice Shape (Su)**\  A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as :ref:`stone shape <corerulebook.spells.stoneshape#stone_shape>`\ , but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.

\ **Ice Tomb (Sp)**\  A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as :ref:`imprisonment <corerulebook.spells.imprisonment#imprisonment>`\ , but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting :ref:`freedom <corerulebook.spells.freedom#freedom>`\  or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based. 

\ **Icewalking (Ex)**\ This ability works like the :ref:`spider climb <corerulebook.spells.spiderclimb#spider_climb>`\  spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to run or charge on ice.

\ **Snow Vision (Ex)**\  A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks while in snow.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A white dragon gains the following spell-like abilities usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile—:ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ ; Young adult—:ref:`gust of wind <corerulebook.spells.gustofwind#gust_of_wind>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`wall of ice <corerulebook.spells.wallofice#wall_of_ice>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`control weather <corerulebook.spells.controlweather#control_weather>`\ .

Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in arctic lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They prefer their meals completely frozen.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Desert Wind (Su)**\  A juvenile or older brass dragon can call up the desert wind to serve him. This functions as :ref:`gust of wind <corerulebook.spells.gustofwind#gust_of_wind>`\ , but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand. The save DC for this effect is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC.

\ **Fire Aura (Su)**\  An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.

\ **Move Sand (Sp)**\  A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as :ref:`move earth <corerulebook.spells.moveearth#move_earth>`\ , but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.

\ **Sandstorm (Su)**\  An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm (\ *PRD Core Rulebook*\ 431), except that it is also accompanied by windstorm-level winds.

\ **Sleep Breath (Su)**\  Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A brass dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Very young—:ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`endure elements <corerulebook.spells.endureelements#endure_elements>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\ ; Old—:ref:`control winds <corerulebook.spells.controlwinds#control_winds>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`control weather <corerulebook.spells.controlweather#control_weather>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`whirlwind <corerulebook.spells.whirlwind#whirlwind>`\ .

\ **Summon Djinni**\  \ **(Sp)**\  This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass dragon once per day, works like a \ *summon monster*\ spell, except that it summons one noble djinni. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Change Shape (Su)**\ A young or older bronze dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using :ref:`polymorph <corerulebook.spells.polymorph#polymorph>`\ . 

\ **Electricity Aura (Su)**\  An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.

\ **Repulsion Breath (Su)**\ Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of :ref:`repulsion <corerulebook.spells.repulsion#repulsion>`\  gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A bronze dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Very young—:ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`create food and water <corerulebook.spells.createfoodandwater#create_food_and_water>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ ; Old—:ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts#detect_thoughts>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`control water <corerulebook.spells.controlwater#control_water>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`control weather <corerulebook.spells.controlweather#control_weather>`\ .

\ **Tidal Wave (Su)**\  A great wyrm bronze dragon can cause the sea to rise up and crush his enemies once per day as a standard action. This affects an area of coastline 120 feet in length and targets all creatures within 40 feet of the shore—treat the targets as if struck by an avalanche (\ *PRD Core Rulebook*\ 429). Treat all creatures as if they were in the bury zone. The save DC to halve this damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Those who fail their saves take full damage and are drawn 60 feet off shore and deposited 20 feet under the surface on the round after the wave hits.

\ **Vortex (Ex)**\  Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a standard action, just like an :ref:`elder water elemental <bestiary.elemental#elemental_water>`\ . A bronze dragon can maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.

\ **Water Breathing (Ex)**\ A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

\ **Wave Mastery (Su)**\  For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.

Special Abilities
==================

:ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  Stone (Ex) A copper dragon can climb on stone surfaces as though using the :ref:`spider climb <corerulebook.spells.spiderclimb#spider_climb>`\  spell.

\ **Deadly Joke (Sp)**\  Once per day, as a standard action, a great wyrm copper dragon can tell a joke that kills. This affects one target, and functions as :ref:`power word kill <corerulebook.spells.powerwordkill#power_word_kill>`\ . This is a language-dependent sonic effect.

\ **Mass Laughter (Sp)**\  An ancient copper dragon can tell a fantastic joke once per day as a standard action. All creatures within 10 feet per age category must make a Will save or laugh for 1 round per age category, as if affected by :ref:`hideous laughter <corerulebook.spells.hideouslaughter#hideous_laughter>`\ . The save DC is Charisma-based. This is equal to a 6th-level spell.

\ **Slow Aura**\  \ **(Su)**\  An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.

\ **Slow Breath (Su)**\  Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\ ) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A copper dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Very young—:ref:`grease <corerulebook.spells.grease#grease>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`hideous laughter <corerulebook.spells.hideouslaughter#hideous_laughter>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`stone shape <corerulebook.spells.stoneshape#stone_shape>`\ ; Old—:ref:`transmute rock to mud <corerulebook.spells.transmuterocktomud#transmute_rock_to_mud>`\ /mud to rock; Ancient—:ref:`wall of stone <corerulebook.spells.wallofstone#wall_of_stone>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`move earth <corerulebook.spells.moveearth#move_earth>`\ .

\ **Trap Master**\  \ **(Ex)**\  A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age categroy on :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (traps) and :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.

Uncanny :ref:`Dodge <corerulebook.feats#dodge>`\  (Ex) A young or older copper dragon is always looking out for an ambush. He can never be caught flat-footed. This ability functions like the rogue ability of the same name.

\ **Environment**\ warm plains

\ **Organization**\  solitary

\ **Treasure**\  triple

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Change Shape (Su)**\ A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day as if using :ref:`polymorph <corerulebook.spells.polymorph#polymorph>`\ .

\ **Detect Gems (Sp)**\  A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as :ref:`locate object <corerulebook.spells.locateobject#locate_object>`\ , but can only be used to locate gemstones.

\ **Divine Aid (Sp)**\  Once a week, a great wyrm gold dragon can call upon celestial powers for aid. This functions as a :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\ . 

\ **Fast Flight (Ex)**\  A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.

\ **Fire Aura (Su)**\  An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.

\ **Luck**\  \ **(Sp)**\  Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A gold dragon gains the following spell-like abilities upon reaching the listed age category. Its caster level for these effects is equal to its Hit Dice, and any save DCs are Charisma-based. A gold dragon can use these abilities at will. Very young—:ref:`detect evil <corerulebook.spells.detectevil#detect_evil>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`bless <corerulebook.spells.bless#bless>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`daylight <corerulebook.spells.daylight#daylight>`\ ; Old—:ref:`geas/quest <corerulebook.spells.geasquest#geas_quest>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`sunburst <corerulebook.spells.sunburst#sunburst>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`foresight <corerulebook.spells.foresight#foresight>`\ .

\ **Weakening Breath (Su)**\ Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).

Gold dragons are the epitome of virtue. Other metallic dragons revere their gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind, and often seek them for advice or aid.

Ecology

\ **Environment**\ temperate mountains

\ **Organization**\  solitary

\ **Treasure**\  triple

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Change Shape (Su)**\ A silver dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day as if using :ref:`polymorph <corerulebook.spells.polymorph#polymorph>`\ .

\ **Cloudwalking (Su)**\  A very young or older silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground.

\ **Cold Aura (Su)**\  An old or older silver dragon is surrounded by an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's aura damage increases to 2d6. A silver dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.

\ **Fog Vision (Ex)**\  A juvenile or older silver dragon can see perfectly well in fog and clouds.

\ **Graceful Flight (Ex)**\ A young or older silver dragon's aerial maneuverability is one step better than normal.

\ **Paralyzing Breath (Su)**\ Instead of a cone of cold, a silver dragon can breathe a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

\ **Reflective Scales (Su)**\  Any spell that targets an ancient or older silver dragon but fails to penetrate the silver dragon's spell resistance might be reflected. If the caster level check to penetrate the dragon's spell resistance is failed by 5 or more, the spell is reflected. If the check fails by 4 or less, the spell is merely wasted. This otherwise functions as :ref:`spell turning <corerulebook.spells.spellturning#spell_turning>`\ .

\ **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)**\  A silver dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Very young—:ref:`detect evil <corerulebook.spells.detectevil#detect_evil>`\ ; Juvenile—:ref:`feather fall <corerulebook.spells.featherfall#feather_fall>`\ ; Adult—:ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ ; Old—:ref:`control winds <corerulebook.spells.controlwinds#control_winds>`\ ; Ancient—:ref:`control weather <corerulebook.spells.controlweather#control_weather>`\ ; Great wyrm—:ref:`reverse gravity <corerulebook.spells.reversegravity#reverse_gravity>`\ .

\ **True Courage (Ex)**\  A great wyrm silver dragon can fight on through pain and death. When reduced to below 0 hit points, it remains conscious, automatically stabilizes, and can continue to act (although it is staggered). If it takes damage or is the target of a spell that causes its death, it remains alive for 1 round and can act normally (it is not staggered for this final round).
