Frost Giants
*************

Natives of snow-capped peaks and primordial lands of unending winter, frost giants consider themselves the rightful inheritors of the world's cold places. They raid, conquer, and take slaves with wanton brutality. Lesser races who shiver and hide from the chilling winds exist only to serve them—as labor, as sport, and sometimes as meat.

Frost giants are among the larger giants, with males standing 15 feet tall and weighing roughly 2,800 pounds, and females being only slightly smaller. Most frost giants have pale blue skin the color of glacial ice, though shades can vary from deep blue to the white of fresh snow. Their hair grows in pale shades of blue, white, or dirty yellow; it is typically worn long and tied in braids, including beards. A frost giant's eyes typically match its hair, though with much more vivid colors. Frost giants' glacial coloration helps them camouflage themselves in the frigid lands they call home, and they often raid during ice storms to further capitalize on this fact.

Frost giants bear nearly the same proportions as humans, if more muscle-bound and broad-shouldered on average. Like other humanoids, they are warm-blooded, but their bodies have adapted to emit only infinitesimal amounts of heat via their skin and breath, and their blood cannot freeze, rendering them impervious to even the most frigid cold. However, their blood boils easily, and they become uncomfortably hot in more moderate climes.

A creature as massive as a frost giant requires a great deal of food to keep going, which the giants supply mostly by hunting and raiding. Caribou, elk, and other megafauna of the frozen reaches make up the bulk of their diet. The skins and hides of these creatures are put to use as clothing, bedding, and tents. Frost giants see no reason to engage in agriculture, mining, or raising livestock, given that their immense strength makes it far easier to raid for what they need. Most goods among the giants are stolen or created by enslaved members of smaller races. Cheese and butter are particularly prized.

About half of all frost giant tribes are seminomadic, migrating between campsites and temporary settlements whenever the local supply of game or plunder begins to run out. The other half take up permanent residence in captured castles or in fortresses carved from stone or ice. The giants' refusal to practice agriculture, however, means that those who settle in one place require relatively large subject populations to raid from, and may even rely on subordinate frost giant tribes that range farther afield and supply them with tribute.

Frost giants' love of raiding is legendary, and rightly feared among mountain towns the world over. They have so perfected the art of raiding that they leave enough residents of a town alive that the town can be rebuilt, allowing them to sack it again later once it's amassed enough loot to be worthwhile. In general, frost giants enjoy combat for its own sake, and prefer a quick plundering to holding territory. They particularly enjoy the thrill of fighting smaller humanoids, as it allows them to sate their bloodlust in relative safety.

Because they value strength over all, frost giants are sometimes brought under the command of yet greater evils. In these cases, they are usually glorified mercenaries, who cooperate as long as they're kept supplied with food, weapons, and riches, be it by pay or by pillage. Yet non-giant individuals capable of cowing a tribe are rare—even white dragons can end up as thralls of powerful frost giant tribes.

The ruler of a frost giant tribe typically assumes the title of jarl. This title is never claimed by means of democracy or heredity, but rather belongs to any with the strength to take it via personal challenge. When two jarls meet, one or the other must cede her title and become a mere "chieftain" or "warlord," an issue usually decided by swift and brutal combat. In this way, a strong jarl can command many subordinate tribes, though these arrangements inevitably prove to be temporary, for frost giants rankle at servitude. Most chieftains are continually second-guessing the jarl's leadership and looking for opportunities to break away or take power for themselves.

As frost giants prefer the glory of combat over the tedium of work, they keep slaves (called thralls) to assist with tasks like preparing food or tanning hides. The giants make poor masters, often killing these thralls through exhaustion or petty cruelty. The giants are also not above eating thralls in lean times, or when the slaves have outlived their usefulness. More successful frost giant tribes sometimes capture hardier creatures such as ice trolls or ogres as thralls—these fare somewhat better, serving as shock troops in the giants' war bands.

One of the few labors the giants take pride in is crafting weapons and armor. They manufacture excellent chain armor, which they prefer to plate, as plate makes noise and has joints that can freeze. For weaponry, they favor enormous greataxes, sometimes hafted with whole trees.

Frost giants enjoy the company of creatures as brutal as themselves, and so take in other tundra creatures as exotic "pets." They favor winter wolves, but frost worms, mammoths, polar bears, svathurims, and yetis are not unknown.

The vast majority of frost giants worship ancient giant deities of blood, ice, and war. The giants dedicate their battles to these gods out of respect, and appease them with sacrifices of slaves and treasure out of fear. More recently, some tribes have turned to the worship of demon lords of brutality, vengeance, and the deadly cold. This has caused something of a schism: the traditionalists accuse the demon-worshipers of turning their backs on their progenitors and becoming thralls to undeserving masters. Yet in truth, most frost giants will worship any god who caters to their desires.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#awesome_charge`: `monstercodex.frostgiants#awesome_charge_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#awesome_charge_(combat)`:

Awesome Charge (Combat)
========================

When you charge, you can send your opponent flying.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Str 25, :ref:`Awesome Blow <bestiary.monsterfeats#awesome_blow>`\ , :ref:`Improved Bull Rush <corerulebook.feats#improved_bull_rush>`\ , :ref:`Power Attack <corerulebook.feats#power_attack>`\ .

\ **Benefit**\ : When you hit your opponent with a charge attack, you can attempt an awesome blow combat maneuver against that opponent as a free action.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#born_of_frost`:

Born of Frost
==============

You exude a chill that can harm other creatures.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Frost giant.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your natural weapons and unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. Creatures that strike you with natural weapons or unarmed strikes take 1 point of cold damage.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#chilled_rock`:

Chilled Rock
=============

You can transfer the cold of your body to the rocks you throw.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Born of Frost, frost giant.

\ **Benefit**\ : Any items you throw with your rock throwing ability are chilled by your touch, dealing an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#cleaving_sweep`: `monstercodex.frostgiants#cleaving_sweep_(combat)`_

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#cleaving_sweep_(combat)`:

Cleaving Sweep (Combat)
========================

You can sweep multiple foes to the ground with a single blow of your axe.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Str 15, :ref:`Cleave <corerulebook.feats#cleave>`\ , Improved Trip, :ref:`Weapon Focus <corerulebook.feats#weapon_focus>`\  (greataxe), base attack bonus +11.

\ **Benefit**\ : When using a full-attack action with a two-handed weapon, you can give up your regular attacks and instead attempt a trip combat maneuver at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#icy_stare`:

Icy Stare
==========

Your eyes burn like ice, allowing you to freeze and weaken foes with a glance.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Born of Frost, frost giant.

\ **Benefit**\ : As a standard action, you can direct your icy stare against a single creature or object within 10 feet. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of cold damage. Unattended objects cannot attempt a saving throw. Creatures damaged by the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage.

This feat doesn't grant an actual gaze attack—foes and allies are not in danger simply by meeting your gaze.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#sure_on_ice`:

Sure on Ice
============

You move on ice and snow as if it were dry ground.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Frost giant.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can move across icy and snowy surfaces without penalty, and don't need to attempt :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to run or charge on ice. You gain a +4 bonus on :ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  checks to climb ice.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#frost_giant_spells`:

Frost Giant Spells
*******************

Frost giants developed the following spells to help them hunt and raid in their icy homes.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#ice_slick`:

Ice Slick
==========

\ **School**\  evocation [cold]; \ **Level**\  druid 2, magus 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Area**\  5-ft.-radius burst

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous (see text)

\ **Save**\  Reflex partial (see text); \ **SR**\  see text

You create a blast of intense cold, coating all solid surfaces in the area with a thin coating of ice. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don't fall prone. Spell resistance applies to this initial effect.

A creature can walk within or through the area of ice at half its normal speed with a successful DC 10 :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  check. Failure by 4 or less means the creature can't move that round (and must succeed at a Reflex save or fall); failure by 5 or more means it falls. Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to attempt this check.

A 5-foot square of ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points. The ice is an instantaneous effect, but persists as nonmagical ice. Under temperate conditions, the ice lasts 1 minute per level. In tropical environments, it might last only half as long. In cold environments where ice and snow persist without melting, it could last indefinitely.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#magic_boulder`:

Magic Boulder
==============

\ **School**\  transmutation [earth]; \ **Level**\  cleric 2, druid 2

\ **Target**\  up to three boulders touched

This spell works like :ref:`magic stone <corerulebook.spells.magicstone#magic_stone>`\ , except you transmute as many as three boulders (rocks up to two size categories smaller than yourself) to use with the rock throwing ability or as siege engine ammunition. The boulder's damage increases by one step, and the boulder gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.

.. _`monstercodex.frostgiants#frost_giant_magic_items`:

Frost Giant Magic Items
************************

Frost giants are reputed to have created the first of these magic items, and most specimens still remain in the hands of their kind. Many a bold hero has sought to infiltrate frost giant strongholds in pursuit of such magical treasures, making dangerous climbs into crag-top castles and glacial palaces. Some of the most successful ones even manage to return home with all of their limbs.

Raiders are the shock troops of frost giant tribes, usually consisting of the tribe's toughest, most intimidating warriors. On raids, they exult in the fear that their mighty appearance causes, often breaking enemy lines with the sheer sight of their howling charge. Unlike frost giant rangers, frost giant raiders are less concerned with stealth or tactics than with impressing each other via dramatic feats, and wiser jarls know when to rein in their troops lest frost giant bravado and a desire for bragging rights lose them a battle—or, more often, result in unnecessary destruction of valuable slaves and plunder.

While larger tribes are usually ruled by a jarl or another powerful figure, in smaller tribes a raider might serve as a leader. Some raiders could even be chieftains who pledge fealty to a mighty jarl's larger clan. Since a frost giant tribe ruled by a mere raider is likely to be easy pickings for a more fearsome tribe looking to increase its holdings, raider-led tribes often find it safer to move out of their traditional homelands and into softer country, and thus they often come into conflict with smaller humanoids.

Ice mages inherit the magic of the icy north. While some are tricksters and manipulators—perhaps using :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  to grow to Huge size and trick travelers into thinking they're cloud giants—many act as support and artillery for their tribe's raiders, killing at a distance with the power of a storm or increasing their allies' size and ferocity. As powerful as sorcerers may be, frost giant society still places more value in physical strength and melee prowess, meaning sorcerers are usually advisors rather than leaders.

A frost giant battle priest uses her powers seeking out those who would undercut her authority or that of the chief, through spying on, manipulating, and threatening the rest of the tribe. When needed, she's not averse to taking up her battleaxe and splitting a few heads.

A houndmaster is responsible for the care of the tribe's pets, frequently polar bears, wolves, and winter wolves. She is fond of pitting her charges against each other, allowing the packs to establish a functional hierarchy and ensuring that only the strongest survive to breed. Some houndmasters choose these pack leaders as animal companions.

Jarls rule their tribes and subordinates with an iron fist—or a hammer to the skull. Jarls take and hold their positions through force. While many might wish to see their stations pass on to their progeny, heredity carries little weight in frost giant society, and jarls understand that their children can assume power only by violently seizing it. As a result, frost giant jarls are hard on their children, encouraging sibling rivalries in hopes that one child will eventually prove strong enough to rule.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Natural Jouster (Ex)**\  A svathurim can wield a lance one-handed as if it were mounted, and it deals double damage with a lance while charging.

\ **Skyrunner (Su)**\  When charging, running, or taking a double move, a svathurim can stride across open air as if it were using :ref:`air walk <corerulebook.spells.airwalk#air_walk>`\  . This movement is very taxing; a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the end of each round it uses this ability or become fatigued for 1 minute. This DC increases by 2 for each round after the first. Returning to the ground resets the DC to 14, but doesn't negate any ongoing fatigue or exhaustion. A svathurim cannot trample when using this ability.

\ **Thunderous Trample (Su)**\  Any creature damaged by a svathurim's trample attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Svathurims and frost giants consider each other allies and distant kin. The hindquarters of an adult svathurim are up to 10 feet tall and 16 feet long, while its giant trunk and head reach up to 18 feet in height. They typically weigh more than 5 tons and may live up to 500 years. Svathurims dwell in arctic regions, galloping along the shores of polar seas or between high mountain peaks, with individuals organized into clans headed by the strongest hunters.
