Animals, Mounts, and Related Gear
**********************************

The animals, mounts, and related gear in this section can be found in most large cities. Based on its location, a settlement might not have all of these animals or related gear available at a given time (as the GM deems fit).

The tables for this section are split up into five categories: Pets and Familiars, Guard and Hunting Animals, Farm and Work Animals, Mounts, and Animal-Related Gear. Animals that fit into more than one category appear on multiple lists.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#animal_harness`:

Animal Harness
===============

\ **Price**\  2 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

This leather or hemp harness allows a holder to restrain and control a domesticated animal. A harness is standard equipment for anyone trying to teach an animal tricks with the :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  skill. Ready-made harnesses are available in most markets for common domesticated animals such as cats, dogs, horses, and oxen, but harnesses can be made for nearly any creature.  

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#axe_beak_combat_trained`: `ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#axe_beak_(combat_trained)`_

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#axe_beak_(combat_trained)`:

Axe Beak (Combat TraineD)
==========================

\ **Price**\  1,500 gp; \ **Weight**\  500 lbs.

These Large avian predators are sometimes used as hunting animals but are prized as mounts.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#axe_beak_egg`:

Axe Beak Egg
=============

\ **Price**\  1,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  10 lbs.

Axe beaks raised from eggs are easily trained as mounts or used as livestock.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#badger`:

Badger
=======

\ **Price**\  15 gp; \ **Weight**\  20 lbs.

These fierce, burrowing creatures are only rarely kept as pets.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#barding`:

Barding
========

\ **Price**\  varies; \ **Weight**\  varies

Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on the :ref:`Armor and Shields table <ultimateequipment.armsandarmor.armor#armor_and_shields_table>`\ .

Armor for a horse (a Large non-humanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much (see the :ref:`Armor for Unusual Creatures table <ultimateequipment.armsandarmor.armor#armor_for_unusual_creatures_table>`\ ). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the price is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.

Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.

Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on the :ref:`Donning Armor table <ultimateequipment.armsandarmor.armor#donning_armor_table>`\ . A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than a rider, and normal saddlebags.

.. list-table::

   * - Barding

     - 40 ft.
   * - Heavy armor
     - 30 ft. \*
     - 35 ft. \*
     - 40 ft. \*

**Notes:**

* A mount wearing heavy armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#bat`:

Bat
====

\ **Price**\  5 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

These Diminutive rodents are nocturnal fliers that eat insects and fruit. They rely primarily on sound to navigate rather than sight. They are absent only in desert and arctic regions. Some cultures keep bat houses near towns and villages to control insect problems. More information on bats can be found in the \ *Bestiary*\ . 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#bit_and_bridle`:

Bit and Bridle
===============

\ **Price**\  2 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

This is headgear used by a rider to control a mount. Bit and bridles for horses, ponies, and riding dogs can be readily purchased in most settlements and bits and bridles can be crafted for any creature that serves as a mount. 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#cage`:

Cage
=====

\ **Price**\  varies; \ **Weight**\  varies

This secure, portable enclosure is used to hold creatures—generally animals, but a large enough cage can hold anything. Cages are made from iron, wood, or bamboo, depending on local customs and available materials. One cage holds one animal of that size, or five animals of a smaller size. The weight of the creature adds to the weight of the cage. Cages come in the following sizes: Diminutive or Fine, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, and Huge. Cages for aquatic creatures cost twice as much, and weigh four times the normal weight when filled with water.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#camel`:

CAMEL
======

\ **Price**\  150 gp; \ **Weight**\  1,500 lbs.

Due to their incredible endurance, these Large animals are the preferred mounts of desert-dwelling people. They tend to be ill-tempered beasts.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#cat`:

Cat
====

\ **Price**\  3 cp; \ **Weight**\  8 lbs.

These Tiny animals are often kept as pets or familiars. Though small, they are excellent hunters. Grain farmers usually keep cats for pest control in crop storage areas, but cats can be found in most regions and strays occupy many cities.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#cat_hunting`:

Cat, Hunting
=============

\ **Price**\  100 gp; \ **Weight**\  100 lbs.

Rarely, Medium cats such as cheetahs and leopards are trained to hunt for humanoid masters. 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#cattle`:

Cattle
=======

\ **Price**\  50 gp; \ **Weight**\  1,500 lbs.

Cattle are kept for milk and meat, and used as beasts of burden. A bull is used primarily for mating. Other males are castrated and become oxen, which are used to carry loads and plow fields.  

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#centipede_house`:

Centipede, House
=================

\ **Price**\  1 cp; \ **Weight**\  3 oz.

These creatures come in many forms, from the lighter-colored 20-legged variety to the darker 300-legged variety. Typically, these arthropods are what pass for pets in the slums, but the young and eccentric often search for the best specimens to serve as familiars. Centipedes employed as familiars have an Intelligence score and lose the mindless trait.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#chicken`:

Chicken
========

\ **Price**\  1 gp; \ **Weight**\  6 lbs.

These domesticated birds are not capable of long distance flights, and are raised for their eggs and meat. Male chickens are kept for mating and occasionally blood sport. 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#crab`:

Crab
=====

\ **Price**\  20 gp; \ **Weight**\  5–7 lbs.

Aquatic spellcasters often find large ocean crabs to be agreeable familiars. Without the bond of a familiar, however, these crustacean's lack of intelligence makes them dull pets.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#dire_bat_riding`:

Dire Bat, Riding
=================

.. list-table::

   * - Common

   * - Combat trained
     - 450 gp
     - 250 lbs.

Considered to be the fastest nonmagical transport in cavernous underground realms, dire bats are domesticated in captivity to serve as riding animals. Stables that accommodate these massive creatures are only commonly found in cities built in larger underground caverns, owing to the greater space required for training and exercise, though the outriders of some subterranean races fly them almost to the surface. These creatures require exotic saddles to ride.

\ *Dire Bat, Riding (combat trained)*\ : These animals are used by scouts and military for war.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#dog`:

Dog

     - 5 lbs.
   * - Riding
     - 150 gp
     - 50 lbs.

Most dogs fall into one of the following categories.

\ *Guard Dog*\ : This Small, combat-trained dog is bred for battle; breeders favor strength, a thick body, and a low center of gravity. Guard dogs are sold in most large cities and some cultures use them for sport fighting or in some armies' special infantry.

\ *Lap Dog*\ : These tiny dogs are commonly kept as pets. They cannot be combat trained, but can serve as noisy-but-skittish watch creatures. Lap dogs have the same statistics as foxes.

\ *Riding Dog*\ : This Medium dog is bred for carrying Small riders, and is combat trained. Breeders select dogs with strong backs, endurance, and loyal dispositions and train them for riding and combat before sale. Reputable breeders can be found in major cities.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#donkey_or_mule`:

Donkey or Mule
===============

\ **Price**\  8 gp; \ **Weight**\  600–800 lbs.

Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places. Donkeys and mules have the same statistics as ponies. 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#donkey_rat`:

Donkey Rat
===========

\ **Price**\  1 gp; \ **Weight**\  50 lbs.

These Tiny capybara-like white rodents are native to temperate swamps and coasts. They are common pets and livestock in some lands.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#duck`:

Duck
=====

\ **Price**\  2 gp; \ **Weight**\  3 lbs.

Farm ducks are used for eggs, meat, and down, while wild ducks are hunted for meat. Ducks have the same statistics as ravens.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#elephant`:

Elephant
=========

\ **Price**\  1,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  5 tons

These Huge animals are exceptionally strong and are quick learners. Some cultures train them for battle or labor. Most known elephants come from savannas or vast rainforest regions. They eat so much that housing them outside of their native environment is expensive.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#falcon`:

Falcon
=======

\ **Price**\  40 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

This Tiny, long-winged hawk is a popular hunting bird among many aristocracies. Falcons are technically a subset of hawks but are considered more "noble" in many cultures. Ownership of these birds is denied to commoners in many nations with hierarchical monarchies.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#falconry_gauntlet`:

Falconry Gauntlet
==================

\ **Price**\  10 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

This gauntlet, made from layers of thick leather, is worn on a falconer's off hand to give a falcon a place to stand before and after the hunt. The gauntlet also has a tassel and a ring to attach to a falcon's tether.  

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#feed`: `ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#feed_(per_day)`_

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#feed_(per_day)`:

Feed (per day)
===============

\ **Price**\  5 cp; \ **Weight**\  10 lbs.

Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze in some regions to sustain themselves, but feed provides more reliable nourishment. Riding dogs and other carnivores can be fed meat for the same cost. Except for horses, other Large creatures need to eat twice the feed of other animals each day. Huge creatures need four times the feed.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#fox`:

Fox
====

\ **Price**\  8 gp; \ **Weight**\  12 lbs.

These quick and wily carnivores can be difficult to train, but often make excellent familiars. Many humanoid communities see these canines as a menace to their farming fowl, and some use dogs to track them during recreational hunts. 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#gecko_riding`:

Gecko, Riding
==============

     - 1,200 lbs.
   * - Combat trained
     - 400 gp
     - 1,500 lbs.

Larger than even giant geckos, these mammoth lizards have been specifically bred to be used as mounts. Prized for their ability to run along cave ceilings and sheer walls, they require exotic saddles to ride. A riding gecko has the same statistics as a giant gecko with the giant template.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#goat`:

Goat
=====

\ **Price**\  6 gp; \ **Weight**\  50 lbs.

As an agricultural animal, goats provide milk, meat, hair, and hide, and they are sometimes used to clear fields of weeds and shrubbery. Some spellcasters bond with them as familiars.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#griffon_combat_trained`: `ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#griffon_(combat_trained)`_

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#griffon_(combat_trained)`:

Griffon (COMBAT TRAINED)
=========================

\ **Price**\  8,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  500 lbs.

These deadly but majestic fliers are the favored aerial cavalry of many kingdoms. While griffons can be trained, some good deities consider doing so akin to enacting slavery, insisting that a griffon must come to its rider on its own free will. The price listed is for a trained griffon; free will is bought with different currency (determined by the GM). 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#griffon_egg`:

Griffon Egg
============

\ **Price**\  3,500 gp; \ **Weight**\  10 lbs.

Unscrupulous adventurers and the desperate sometimes steal eggs from griffon nests, as trainers find it easier to raise a griffon from a hatchling than trying to train a spirited adult.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#hawk`:

Hawk
=====

\ **Price**\  18 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

This Tiny, short-winged raptor is a popular hunting bird, but is utilized more often by lower nobility than by commoners without titles. Hawks are known for their sharp eyesight and powerful aerial dives.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#hedgehog`:

Hedgehog
=========

\ **Price**\  5 gp; \ **Weight**\  3 lbs.

These spiny mammals roll into a ball when threatened. They are sometimes kept as pets and are favored by some wizards as familiars.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#hippogriff_combat_trained`: `ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#hippogriff_(combat_trained)`_

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#hippogriff_(combat_trained)`:

HIPPOGRIFF (COMBAT TRAINED)
============================

\ **Price**\  5,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  500 lbs.

Less intelligent and easier to train than griffons, hippogriffs make reliable winged mounts.

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#hippogriff_egg`:

Hippogriff Egg
===============

\ **Price**\  200 gp; \ **Weight**\  10 lbs.

While it is easier to train a full-grown hippogriff than a griffon, the eggs of these creatures are still prized by breeders. 

.. _`ultimateequipment.gear.animalsandtransports#horse`:
