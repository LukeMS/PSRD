An ancient relative of the smaller leatherback sea turtle, the archelon can grow up to 13 feet long and 16 feet from flipper to flipper. Weighing as much as 5,000 pounds, the archelon has an exceedingly powerful bite, and doesn't hesitate to use it to deter aquatic nuisances.
Like other sea turtles, female archelons come ashore to lay and bury their eggs in sandy beaches, preferably facing deep water and without coral reefs. Once done, they return to the sea, leaving their eggs defenseless.
These creatures are often used by coastal tribes as guardians and escorts from island to island. Aquatic creatures, particularly locathah, often use them as beasts of burden, but their relatively slow swim speed makes them poor mounts.

The immense baluchitherium stands nearly 18 feet high at the shoulder, measures 30 feet from end to end, and weighs 40,000 pounds. Despite its size, it lives a peaceful life pulling leaves from the tops of trees unless startled into action. When panicked, a baluchitherium tramples any obstacle in its path. If confronted, it smashes its tormentors with its elephantine feet.
A properly trained baluchitherium makes a capable mount for ettins, ogres, smaller giants, or other Large humanoids, and is one of the few mammals other than an elephant able to fill that role. Its relatively ponderous pace limits its usefulness to some extent, but its strength often more than makes up for this shortcoming.

Despite their saurian name, basilosauruses are in fact oceanic mammals, and at 60 feet in length are highly formidable beasts of the sea. In appearance, they resemble greatly elongated whales, but with long, toothed jaws resembling an alligator's. Inexperienced observers often confuse a basilosaurus with a sea serpent or water orm—and in all fairness, in the aftermath of a basilosaurus attack on an unsuspecting ship, such distinctions are largely academic anyway.
A basilosaurus relies as much on vision as echolocation to find prey, but sometimes mistakes smaller ships for food. Basilosauruses have few natural predators; only supernatural monsters like krakens, thalassic behemoths, and the largest of sea serpents can truly threaten a fully grown one.

The immense megalania is often mistaken for a dragon or dinosaur. Certainly the lizard's aggressive attitude and deep, rumbling roars only encourage such misidentifications. Large enough to catch and eat rhinos and elephants, a megalania prefers hunting much smaller prey that it can gulp down in one greedy swallow. Humanoids are among its favorite meals. 
A megalania is 20 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds.
