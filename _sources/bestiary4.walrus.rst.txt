Walruses normally have gray or brown hides, fading to nearly white when immersed in cold water, and turning pink from increased blood flow when basking in the sun. A thick layer of blubber serves as protection from both predators and cold.

A typical male walrus weighs 1 to 2 tons and measures 10 feet in length, with females about a third lighter and about 9 feet long. Both sexes have tusks up to 3 feet long, and stiff whiskers used to feel out the hiding places of shellfish. A walrus lives up to 40 years.

Owing to their fearsome tusks, prodigious strength, and willingness to fight as a herd, only the most aggressive or hungry polar predators risk attacking an adult walrus. People hunt walruses for meat and for their tusks, valued for their worth as ivory and as impressive trophies in their own right.

Walrus, Emperor
****************

Thick folds of skin protect this massive sea mammal like fleshy armor. Tusks as tall as humans jut from its whiskered face.

Towering over common walruses, emperor walruses live in only the most secluded arctic areas. They might be throwbacks to an earlier age of giant animals or bred by druids to be superior arctic predators. They often live in the company of common walruses, but are far more aggressive, driving off or killing any potential threats to the herd. Emperor walruses have a similar diet to common walruses, but may also eat giant crabs, seals, large fish, and seabirds.

A full-grown male emperor walrus measures 20 feet in length and weighs around 16 tons, with tusks up to 6 feet long. It can live up to 80 years.
