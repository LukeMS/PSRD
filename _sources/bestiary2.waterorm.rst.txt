A reptilian head on a serpentine neck slowly surfaces. Shadows beneath the water hint at a body of considerable size.

Special Abilities
==================
\ **Elusive (Su)**\  Water orms are rarely discovered except by their own choice. As a full-round action while in water, a water orm can move up to its run speed (200 ft.) without leaving any trace of its passage (identical in effect to :ref:`pass without trace <corerulebook.spells.passwithouttrace#pass_without_trace>`\ ). An elusive water orm gains a +40 circumstance bonus to its :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  check. In addition, when not in combat, a water orm is considered to be under the effects of a :ref:`nondetection <corerulebook.spells.nondetection#nondetection>`\  spell. These effects function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.
\ **Water Travel (Su)**\  As a full-round action once per day, a water orm can dissolve into water, appearing only as a long, dark, serpentine stretch of water that looks similar to the passage of a school of fish when viewed from above the water. While in this form, the water orm swims at a speed of 600 feet per round (60 mph) and gains a +40 bonus on all :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  checks. It cannot attack or take any action other than swimming in this form, and can remain in this form for up to 8 hours at a time. A water orm can revert to its solid form from this state as a free action. Water orms are unable to pass into or through salt water when using this ability. 
Just as sailors tell stories of sea serpents, so do denizens on the shores of remote lakes whisper of strange, secretive monsters lurking in the depths of these large bodies of water. Like sea serpents, proof of their existence is as elusive as the beasts themselves. Known as water orms and believed by some to be a strange link between linnorms and sea serpents, most locals refer to any such local monster (real or imagined) by a pet name or the name of the lake it calls home. Water orms are craftier than sea serpents, and generally inclined toward curiosity rather than violence. Nevertheless, a water orm does not hesitate to attack any creature it views as a threat to itself or its lake.
Water orms are extremely long-lived. Several different variants have been reported. With sightings rare and unverifiable, it is unclear whether these are variations within a single species, or several unrelated creatures. Some are described as long-necked aquatic reptiles, some as fresh-water sea serpents, others as bizarrely elongated seals or whales, and still others as impossibly large sea horses. Most are 40 to 45 feet in length, and weigh 2,000 to 3,000 pounds.
