Special Abilities
==================

\ **Devouring grapple (Ex)**\  The mouth at the center of a baregara's chest automatically deals 2d8+4 points of damage per round to any creature the baregara successfully grapples.

\ **Monstrous Challenge (Su)**\  As a standard action, a baregara can make an :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  check to demoralize an opponent. If this check is successful, the baregara surges with power and gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution for 10 minutes. This ability is usable three times per day.

\ **One-Armed Hold (Ex)**\  A baregara's huge arms allow it to initiate and maintain a grapple without the standard –4 penalty for not having both hands free.

Although natives of the Abyss that often serve as minions for powerful demons or demon lords, baregaras are not in fact demons themselves. Some scholars classify them as "proto-demons"—monsters like bebiliths or xacabras that could perhaps someday complete their supernatural evolution into full demonic glory, but that have not quite yet reached that end. Of course, to the baregara's victims, these debates are incidental.

In the Abyss, baregaras form small troops just like the apes of the Material Plane. These troops are led by the strongest fighter or an individual anointed by a powerful demon the baregara troop serves. Rivalries between troops are part of a complex hierarchy that is all but incomprehensible to non-baregaras, but planar scholars have observed that all baregaras take trophies from notable kills, and that these grisly mementos play some role in establishing the convoluted social standing of the troop leaders and their followers.

Even when knuckle-walking on their enormous hands, baregaras stand over 12 feet high when measured to the top of their horns, and their dense bodies can weigh up to 1,500 pounds.
