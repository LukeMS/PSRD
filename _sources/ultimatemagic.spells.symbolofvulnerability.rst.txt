Symbol of Vulnerability
========================

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorous, plus powdered diamond opal worth a total of 15,000 gp)

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

This spell functions as :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except it saps the defenses of all creatures within 60 feet. Affected creatures receive a –4 penalty to spell resistance and a –4 penalty on saving throws, and energy resistances and damage reduction (if any) are reduced by 10 each (to a minimum of 0). Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per level. The effects last as long as the creature is within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round per caster level afterward.

\ *Symbol of vulnerability*\  can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell by a caster of 18h level or higher for the cost of 25,000 gp.
