Nondetection
=============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  ranger 4, sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (diamond dust worth 50 gp)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature or object touched

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless, object); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless, object)

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as :ref:`clairaudience/clairvoyance <corerulebook.spells.clairaudienceclairvoyance#clairaudience_clairvoyance>`\ , :ref:`locate object <corerulebook.spells.locateobject#locate_object>`\ , and \ *detect*\ spells. \ *Nondetection*\ also prevents location by such magic items as \ *crystal ball*\ s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast \ *nondetection*\ . If you cast \ *nondetection*\ on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, \ *nondetection*\ wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
