Unliving Rage
==============

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Targets**\  one willing undead creature per 3 levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  concentration + 1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

This spell functions as :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage>`\ , except it affects only undead creatures and bolsters them with necromantic energy rather than emotion. Each affected creature gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Charisma, a +1 profane bonus on Will saves, and a â€“2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage.
