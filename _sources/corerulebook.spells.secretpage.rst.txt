S\ *ecret page*\ alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. :ref:`Explosive runes <corerulebook.spells.explosiverunes#explosive_runes>`\  or :ref:`sepia snake sigil <corerulebook.spells.sepiasnakesigil#sepia_snake_sigil>`\  can be cast upon the \ *secret page.*

A :ref:`comprehend languages <corerulebook.spells.comprehendlanguages#comprehend_languages>`\  spell alone cannot reveal a \ *secret page*\ 's contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its \ *secret page*\ form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\  spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. :ref:`True seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\  reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with :ref:`comprehend languages <corerulebook.spells.comprehendlanguages#comprehend_languages>`\ . A \ *secret page*\ spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an \ *erase*\ spell.
