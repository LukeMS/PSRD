Wondrous Items
###############

This is a catch all category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).

\ **Physical Description**\ : Varies.

\ **Activation**\ : Usually use-activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.

\ **Special Qualities**\ : Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes (see :ref:`Intelligent Items <corerulebook.magicitems.intelligentitems>`\ ).

Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#extradimensional_spaces`:

Extradimensional Spaces
************************

A number of spells and magic items utilize extradimensional spaces, such as \ *rope trick*\ , a \ *bag of holding*\ , a \ *handy haversack*\ , and a \ *portable hole*\ . These spells and magic items create a tiny pocket space that does not exist in any dimension. Such items do not function, however, inside another extradimensional space. If placed inside such a space, they cease to function until removed from the extradimensional space. For example, if a \ *bag of holding*\  is brought into a\ *rope trick*\ , the contents of the \ *bag of holding*\  become inaccessible until the \ *bag of holding*\  is taken outside the \ *rope trick*\ . The only exception to this is when a\ *bag of holding*\  and a \ *portable hole*\  interact, forming a rift to the Astral Plane, as noted in their descriptions.

This amulet grants an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural weapons. 

Alternatively, this amulet can grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. See Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. An \ *amulet of mighty fists*\  cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. An \ *amulet of mighty fists*\  does not need to have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability.

This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\ . However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15 :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01–60 on d%) or to a random plane (61–100).

This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a :ref:`nondetection <corerulebook.spells.nondetection#nondetection>`\  spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the wearer had cast :ref:`nondetection <corerulebook.spells.nondetection#nondetection>`\  on herself).

\ **Aura**\  strong evocation and transmutation; \ **CL**\  19th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  90,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  500 lbs.

Description
============

At first glance, an inactive \ *apparatus of the crab*\  appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20 Perception check, reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus's movements and actions.

Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.

When active, an \ *apparatus of the crab*\  has the following characteristics: \ **hp**\  200; \ **hardness**\  15; \ **Spd**\  20 ft., swim 20 ft.; :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  20 (–1 size, +11 natural); \ **Attack**\  2 pincers +12 melee (2d8); :ref:`CMB <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_bonus>`\  +14; :ref:`CMD <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_defense>`\  24.

Bag of Holding
===============

\ **Aura**\  moderate conjuration;\ **CL**\ 9th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  see below; \ **Weight**\ see below

Description
============

This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The \ *bag of holding*\ opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type IV
     - 60 lbs.
     - 1,500 lbs.
     - 250 cubic ft.
     - 10,000 gp

If a \ *bag of holding*\  is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a \ *bag of holding*\ is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a \ *bag of holding*\ is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.

If a \ *bag of holding*\ is placed within a \ *portable hole,*\  a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a \ *portable hole*\ is placed within a \ *bag of holding,*\ it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the \ *portable hole*\ and \ *bag of holding*\ in the process.

Bag of Tricks

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  3,400 gp (gray); 8,500 gp (rust); 16,000 gp (tan)

Description
============

This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of \ *bags of tricks*\ produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

The heavy horse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.

Bead of Force
==============

\ **Aura**\  moderate evocation;\ **CL**\ 10th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  3,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  —

Description
============

This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A \ *bead of force*\  can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.

Once thrown, a \ *bead of force*\  functions like a :ref:`resilient sphere <corerulebook.spells.resilientsphere#resilient_sphere>`\  spell (:ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a \ *rod of cancellation,*\ a rod of negation, :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\ , or a targeted :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.

Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.

A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.

Chime of Interruption
======================

\ **Aura**\  moderate evocation;\ **CL**\ 7th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  16,800 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

Description
============

This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.

While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level).

Chime of Opening
=================

\ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation;\ **CL**\ 11th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  3,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

Description
============

A \ *chime of opening*\ is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A \ *chime of opening*\ also automatically dispels a :ref:`hold portal <corerulebook.spells.holdportal#hold_portal>`\  spell or even an \ *arcane lock*\ cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.

The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level of 11th. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and \ *arcane locked,*\ it takes four successful uses of a \ *chime of opening*\ to get it open. A \ *silence*\ spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.

This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical \ *crystal ball*\  to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell :ref:`scrying <corerulebook.spells.scrying#scrying>`\  (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  DC 16 negates). A \ *crystal ball*\  can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.

Description
============

This device is just under an inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth, but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to put up a special cube made up of 6 individual :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`\  spells, 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when fully charged—charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table.

When the \ *cube of force*\ is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. The charge cost to maintain each of the cube's six walls is summarized below.

Description
============

This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface)\ *.*\ The temperature within this area is always at least 65Â° F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.

\ **Aura**\  strong conjuration;\ **CL**\ 13th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  164,000 gp; \ **Weight**\ 2 lbs.

Description
============

This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.

If a side of the \ *cubic gate*\ is pressed once, it opens a :ref:`gate <corerulebook.spells.gate#gate>`\  to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the :ref:`gate <corerulebook.spells.gate#gate>`\ . It is impossible to open more than one :ref:`gate <corerulebook.spells.gate#gate>`\  at a time.

If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  saves.

==========================

\ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation;\ **CL**\ 9th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  9,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

Description
============

If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type of water as well as the volume and velocity.

*  "Stream" pours out 1 gallon per round.

*  "Fountain" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.

*  "Geyser" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.

The geyser effect exerts considerable pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down each round the effect is maintained. In addition, the powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of water without needing to make an attack role to strike the target since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to aim. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d4 points of damage per round from the geyser rather than 1d4. The command word must be spoken to stop it.

Description
============

This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of 34 cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a :ref:`major image <corerulebook.spells.majorimage#major_image>`\  of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)

These shackles have golden runes traced across their cold iron links.

These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a :ref:`fear <corerulebook.spells.fear#fear>`\  spell (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  DC 16 partial). \ *Drums of panic*\  can be used once per day.

Dust of Appearance
===================

\ **Aura**\  faint conjuration;\ **CL**\ 5th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  1,800 gp; \ **Weight**\ —

Description
============

This powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of :ref:`blur <corerulebook.spells.blur#blur>`\  and :ref:`displacement <corerulebook.spells.displacement#displacement>`\ . In this, it works just like the :ref:`faerie fire <corerulebook.spells.faeriefire#faerie_fire>`\  spell. The dust also reveals figments, :ref:`mirror image <corerulebook.spells.mirrorimage#mirror_image>`\ s, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its Stealth checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.

\ *Dust of appearance*\  is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.

======================

\ **Aura**\  moderate illusion;\ **CL**\ 7th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  3,500 gp; \ **Weight**\ —

Description
============

This dust looks like \ *dust of appearance*\  and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`\ ). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including :ref:`see invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\  or :ref:`invisibility purge <corerulebook.spells.invisibilitypurge#invisibility_purge>`\ . :ref:`Dust of appearance <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#dust_of_appearance>`\ , however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by \ *dust of disappearance*\ . Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`\  bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.

\ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation;\ **CL**\ 11th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  850 gp; \ **Weight**\ —

Description
============

This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.

If the dust is employed against an outsider with the elemental and water subtypes, the creature must make a DC 18 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.

Description
============

This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put \ *dust of illusion*\ on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a :ref:`disguise self <corerulebook.spells.disguiseself#disguise_self>`\  glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.

Dust of Tracelessness
======================

\ **Aura**\  faint transmutation;\ **CL**\ 3rd

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  250 gp; \ **Weight**\ —

Description
============

This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.

A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  1,800 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

Description
============

This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about 20 arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staves, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it.

Description
============

This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bitter-smelling smoke issues from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three \ *wishes.*\  In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.

An elemental gem comes in one of four different varieties. Each contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific elemental plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).

When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a\ *summon nature's ally*\  spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.

Description
============

Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. A particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed—even tokens with identical powers can be wildly different in appearance.

\ *Anchor*\ : A token that creates an anchor that moors a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to 1 day.

\ *Bird*\ : A token that creates a small bird that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.

\ *Fan*\ : A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.

\ *Swan Boat*\ : A token that forms a swan-like boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear, 32 Medium characters, or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for 1 day.

\ *Tree*\ : A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot-diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.

\ *Whip*\ : A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a \ *dancing weapon*\ . The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of nonlethal damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple attack (with a +15 bonus on its combat maneuver checks) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.

Description
============

Each of the several kinds of \ *figurines of wondrous power*\  appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.

If a \ *figurine of wondrous power*\ is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#bronze_griffon`:

\ **Bronze Griffon**\ : When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#ebony_fly`:

\ **Ebony Fly**\ : When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#golden_lions`:

\ **Golden Lions**\ : These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#ivory_goats`:

\ **Ivory Goats**\ : These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:

*  \ *The Goat of Traveling*\ : This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used.

*  \ *The Goat of Travail*\ : This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.

*  \ *The Goat of Terror*\ : When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a \ *+3 heavy lance,*\  the other as a \ *+5 longsword*\ ). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates :ref:`fear <corerulebook.spells.fear#fear>`\  as the spell in a 30-foot radius (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#marble_elephant`:

\ **Marble Elephant**\ : This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#obsidian_steed`:

\ **Obsidian Steed**\ : This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: :ref:`overland flight <corerulebook.spells.overlandflight#overland_flight>`\ , :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\ , and :ref:`ethereal jaunt <corerulebook.spells.etherealjaunt#ethereal_jaunt>`\ . The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\ s, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means. Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ , :ref:`etherealness <corerulebook.spells.etherealness#etherealness>`\ , fly, :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#onyx_dog`:

\ **Onyx Dog**\ : When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the :ref:`scent <corerulebook.glossary#scent>`\  ability and adds +4 on its Perception checks. It has 60-foot :ref:`darkvision <corerulebook.glossary#darkvision>`\ , and it can :ref:`see invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\ . An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#serpentine_owl`:

\ **Serpentine Owl**\ : This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#silver_raven`:

\ **Silver Raven**\ : This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an :ref:`animal messenger <corerulebook.spells.animalmessenger#animal_messenger>`\  spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous. Moderate enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`animal messenger <corerulebook.spells.animalmessenger#animal_messenger>`\ , :ref:`animate objects <corerulebook.spells.animateobjects#animate_objects>`\ .

This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as with the :ref:`rusting grasp <corerulebook.spells.rustinggrasp#rusting_grasp>`\  spell.

Gem of Brightness
==================

\ **Aura**\  moderate evocation;\ **CL**\ 6th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  13,000 gp; \ **Weight**\ —

Description
============

This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.

*  One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.

*  Another command word causes the \ *gem of brightness*\  to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is :ref:`blinded <corerulebook.glossary#blinded>`\  for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.

*  The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save or be :ref:`blinded <corerulebook.glossary#blinded>`\  for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

A newly created \ *gem of brightness*\  has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.

This device is a single leather glove. On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If the glove's effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly. A \ *glove of storing*\ uses up your entire hands slot. You may not use another item (even another \ *glove of storing*\ ) that also uses the hands slot.

Description
============

A \ *golem manual*\  contains information, incantations, and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem.

The spells included in a \ *golem manual*\  require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.

Description
============

A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a :ref:`bag of holding <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#bag_of_holding>`\  and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

Helm of Brilliance
===================

\ **Aura**\  strong varied;\ **CL**\ 13th

\ **Slot**\  head; \ **Price**\  125,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  3 lbs.

Description
============

This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:

*  Diamond: :ref:`Prismatic spray <corerulebook.spells.prismaticspray#prismatic_spray>`\  (save DC 20)

*  Ruby: :ref:`Wall of fire <corerulebook.spells.walloffire#wall_of_fire>`

*  Fire opal: :ref:`Fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\  (10d6, :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  DC 20 half)

*  Opal: :ref:`Daylight <corerulebook.spells.daylight#daylight>`

The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a \ *helm of brilliance*\  also has the following magical properties when activated.

*  It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.

*  The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a :ref:`flaming weapon <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_flaming>`\ . This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a :ref:`flaming weapon <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_flaming>`\ ). The command takes 1 round to take effect.

*  The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.

Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.

If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become :ref:`prismatic spray <corerulebook.spells.prismaticspray#prismatic_spray>`\ s that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line :ref:`walls of fire <corerulebook.spells.walloffire#wall_of_fire>`\  extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\ s centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.

The wearer of this helmet can see underwater.

(Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.)

This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be :ref:`deafened <corerulebook.glossary#deafened>`\  for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening).

This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an :ref:`obscuring mist <corerulebook.spells.obscuringmist#obscuring_mist>`\  spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes.

Description

These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal's hooves, they increase the animal's base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus.

These four iron shoes are affixed like normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that non-solid or unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed.

When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  check.

When a divine spellcaster lights a block of \ *incense of meditation*\  and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).

Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.

Description
============

This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even :ref:`knock <corerulebook.spells.keenedge#keen_edge>`\  spells can't open the door.

The :ref:`adamantine <corerulebook.equipment#adamantine>`\  walls of an \ *instant fortress*\  have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  or a :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\ , which restores 50 points of damage taken.

The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (:ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  DC 19 half).

The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.

Description
============

These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. The powers of each stone vary depending on its color and shape (see the table).

Description
============

This potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.

When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if :ref:`pinned <corerulebook.glossary#pinned>`\ ) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. \ *Iron bands of binding*\  are usable once per day.

Description
============

These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature. 

The command word can be used only once per day.

If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:

Description
============

This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a \ *horn of blasting*\ , a :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\  spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.

The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.

Description
============

These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of \ *marvelous pigments*\  is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. 

Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. \ *Marvelous pigments*\  cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments—precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on—appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. The effect is instantaneous.

This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale wood is typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull with a missing lower jaw, allowing the bottom half of the wearer's face to remain visible when the mask is worn.

Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save or take 130 points of damage, as if affected by a :ref:`finger of death <corerulebook.spells.fingerofdeath#finger_of_death>`\  spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user.

\ **Aura**\  strong abjuration;\ **CL**\ 17th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  200,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  50 lbs.

Description
============

This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A \ *mirror of life trapping*\  has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).

When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.

If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (Hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

Description
============

This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day. Destroying the mirror (Hardness 1, 5 hit points) causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish.

Description
============

This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as :ref:`cloudkill <corerulebook.spells.cloudkill#cloudkill>`\  and :ref:`stinking cloud <corerulebook.spells.stinkingcloud#stinking_cloud>`\  effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.

Necklace of Fireballs
======================

\ **Slot**\  neck (does not take up slot); \ **Price**\  1,650 gp (type I), 2,700 gp (type II), 4,350 gp (type III), 5,400 gp (type IV), 5,850 gp (type V), 8,100 gp (type VI), 8,700 gp (type VII); \ **Weight**\ 1 lb.

Description
============

This item appears to be a string of beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\  spell (:ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  DC 14 half).

Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.

Each \ *necklace of fireballs*\  contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Description
============

This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save or become :ref:`frightened <corerulebook.glossary#frightened>`\  for 4 rounds.

Description
============

If the possessor learns the proper tune, he can use these pipes to attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. The Perform DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called in a 24-hour period.

If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.

Portable Hole
==============

\ **Aura**\  strong conjuration;\ **CL**\ 12th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  20,000 gp; \ **Weight**\ —

Description
============

A \ *portable hole*\  is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight, resulting in a portable extradimensional space. When opened fully, a \ *portable hole*\  is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item.

The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each \ *portable hole*\  opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a \ *bag of holding*\  is placed within a \ *portable hole*\ , a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a \ *portable hole*\  is placed within a \ *bag of holding*\ , it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the \ *portable hole*\  and \ *bag of holding*\  being destroyed in the process.

Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as :ref:`neutralize poison <corerulebook.spells.neutralizepoison#neutralize_poison>`\  with a +5 bonus on the check). Applied to a diseased area, it removes disease (as :ref:`remove disease <corerulebook.spells.removedisease#remove_disease>`\  with a +5 bonus on the check).

Description
============

These always come in pairs—two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a \ *ring gate.*\  A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has an "entry side" and an "exit side," both marked with appropriate symbols.

=====================

\ **Aura**\  strong varied;\ **CL**\ 14th

\ **Slot**\  body; \ **Price**\  75,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

Description
============

This normal-appearing garment can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item's powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows.

*  +5 armor bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\ .

*  :ref:`Spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  18.

*  +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

*  +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\ .

As mentioned above, all \ *robes of the archmagi*\  are attuned to a specific alignment. If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three permanent :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ . The same is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two permanent :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ . While these :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including \ *restoration*\  spells), they are immediately removed if the robe is removed.

Description
============

Once per day this simple wool robe allows you to assume the form of another humanoid creature, as if using :ref:`alter self <corerulebook.spells.alterself#alter_self>`\ . This change lasts for 1 hour, although you can end it prematurely as a free action.

Description
============

This sinister item functions much like a :ref:`robe of useful items <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#robe_of_useful_items>`\  for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery, recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created \ *robe of bones*\ always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:

*  Human skeleton

*  Wolf skeleton

*  Heavy horse skeleton

*  Fast goblin zombie

*  Tough human zombie

*  Plague ogre zombie

Description
============

The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are :ref:`dazed <corerulebook.glossary#dazed>`\  for 1d4+1 rounds (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.

Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment).

The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously.

The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.

Description
============

This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of \ *salve of slipperiness,*\  and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the \ *salve of slipperiness*\  must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container.

The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless.

This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried.

Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list.

.. list-table::

   * - \ *Bead of summons*
     - Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the \ *bead of summons*\ to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a \ *geas*\ upon him as punishment at the very least.)
   * - \ *Bead of wind walking*
     - Wearer can cast :ref:`wind walk <corerulebook.spells.windwalk#wind_walk>`\ .

A \ *lesser strand of prayer beads*\  has a \ *bead of blessing*\  and a \ *bead of healing*\ . A \ *strand of prayer beads*\  has a \ *bead of healing*\ , a \ *bead of karma,*\  and a \ *bead of smiting*\ . A \ *greater strand of prayer beads*\  has a \ *bead of healing*\ , a \ *bead of karma*\ , a \ *bead of summons*\ , and a \ *bead of wind walking*\ .

Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the \ *bead of summons*\ , which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The \ *beads of blessing, smiting,*\  and \ *wind walking*\  function as spell trigger items; the \ *beads of karma*\  and \ *summons*\ can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the \ *strand of prayer beads*\  in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.

The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: \ *bead of blessing*\  –600 gp, \ *bead of healing*\  –9,000 gp, \ *bead of karma*\  –20,000 gp, \ *bead of smiting*\  –16,800 gp, \ *bead of summons*\  –20,000 gp, \ *bead of wind walking*\ –46,800 gp.

Description
============

When applied to any matter that was once alive, such as wood, paper, or a dead body, this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as four Medium objects.

This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a :ref:`portable hole <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#portable_hole>`\ .
