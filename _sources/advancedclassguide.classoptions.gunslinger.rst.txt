Gunslinger
###########

Like swashbucklers, gunslingers fight with style and finesse. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#dares`:

Dares
******

Dares are similar to deeds in that they grant a gunslinger or a swashbuckler extra abilities based on either grit or panache, but unlike deeds, dares become active when a member of these classes runs out of her grit or panache, and become inactive until the character regains grit or panache. A dare grants the character a benefit and makes it easier to regain either grit or panache.

A dare can be taken in place of one of the bonus feats a gunslinger or a swashbuckler gains at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A gunslinger or a swashbuckler can choose to have multiple dares, but must pick only one to be active each time she reaches 0 grit points or panache points. Once chosen, the active dare cannot be changed until the gunslinger or swashbuckler reaches 0 grit points or panache points again.

These dares can be used by gunslingers and swashbucklers. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#vigilant_shooter`:

\ *Vigilant Shooter*\ : While this dare is active, you gain the evasion class feature. If you already have this class feature, while this dare is active you roll twice when making a Reflex saving throw and take the higher result. You regain 1 grit point or panache point when you succeed at two Reflex saving throws while using this dare.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#frantically_nimble`:

\ *Frantically Nimble*\ : While this dare is active, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. You regain 1 grit point or panache point when any enemy making a ranged or melee attack against you misses you three consecutive times. The attacks don't need to come from the same enemy. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#out_for_blood`:

\ *Out for Blood*\ : While this dare is active, your critical threat range with firearms (for gunslingers) or light or one-handed piercing melee weapons (for swashbucklers) increases by 1 (20/×4 becomes 19–20/×4, 19–20/×2 becomes 18–20/×2, and so on). This effect does not stack with similar effects that modify a weapon's critical threat range. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#run_like_hell`:

\ *Run Like Hell*\ : While this dare is active, your base speed increases by 10 feet, and you retain your Dexterity bonus to your AC while running. You regain 1 grit or panache point the first time you are more than 100 feet away from your closest enemy.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#bolt_ace_(archetype)`:

Bolt Ace (Archetype)
*********************

While most gunslingers are full of sound and fury, a few never soil their hands with powder or smell gun smoke. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#crossbow_naven`:

\ **Crossbow Maven**\ : A bolt ace is proficient with all crossbows instead of all firearms and begins play with a masterwork crossbow of her choice. This ability alters the gunslinger's weapon proficiencies and replaces gunsmith.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#grit`:

\ **Grit (Ex)**\ : A bolt ace regains grit when she scores a critical hit or deals a killing blow with any kind of crossbow. This ability modifies the grit class feature. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#bolt_ace_deeds`:

\ **Deeds**\ : A bolt ace can perform the following deeds with a crossbow instead of a firearm: gunslinger initiative, pistol-whip, dead shot, targeting, bleeding wound, death's shot, and stunning shot. The bolt ace gains the following deeds.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#sharp_shoot`:

\ *Sharp Shoot*\ : At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs (such as :ref:`Signature Deed <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#signature_deed>`\ ). This deed replaces deadeye. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#vigilant_loading`:

\ *Vigilant Loading*\ : At 1st level, as long as a bolt ace has at least 1 grit point, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when loading a crossbow. This deed replaces quick clear. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#shooters_resolve`:

\ *Shooter's Resolve*\ : At 3rd level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when making a crossbow attack as a standard action and ignore the effects of concealment (though not total concealment) and cover (other than total cover) against that shot. This deed replaces utility shot.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#distracting_shot`:

\ *Distracting Shot*\ : At 7th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point and choose to miss a target that she could normally attack within her range with a crossbow attack. When she does, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round. This deed replaces startling shot. 

\ *Vigilant Shooter*\ : At 11th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when firing a crossbow to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity while doing so. This deed replaces expert loading. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#inexplicable_reload`:

\ *Inexplicable Reload*\ : At 11th level, loading a crossbow becomes unthinking and automatic for a bolt ace. As long as she has at least 1 grit point, she always starts each round of combat (even a surprise round) with her crossbow loaded. Also, the amount of time needed to reload a crossbow decreases by one step: a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes not an action. This deed replaces lightning reload.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#pinning_shot`:

\ *Pinning Shot*\ : At 15th level, the bolt ace can spend 1 grit point while shooting a crossbow and attempt to pin down its target with the bolt. If the crossbow attack hits, it pins the target to a nearby object, to a wall, or to the ground, entangling and staggering the target. While pinned by the bolt, the target cannot move (except by teleportation) until it takes a standard action to free itself from the pinning bolt. This deed replaces menacing shot.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.gunslinger#crossbow_training_(ex)`:

\ **Crossbow Training (Ex)**\ : Starting at 5th level, a bolt ace can select one specific type of crossbow, such as hand crossbow or heavy crossbow. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier with that crossbow. Furthermore, when she scores a critical hit with that type of crossbow, her critical modifier increases by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). 

Every 4 levels thereafter, she can pick a different type of crossbow, gaining the bonus damage and increased critical multiplier with that type of crossbow as well. This ability replaces gun training.
