Ghoul touch
============

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (cloth from a ghoul or earth from a ghoul's lair)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  living humanoid touched

\ **Duration**\  1d6+2 rounds

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.

A :ref:`paralyzed <corerulebook.glossary#paralyzed>`\  subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become :ref:`sickened <corerulebook.glossary#sickened>`\  (:ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates). A :ref:`neutralize poison <corerulebook.spells.neutralizepoison#neutralize_poison>`\  spell removes the effect from a :ref:`sickened <corerulebook.glossary#sickened>`\  creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.
