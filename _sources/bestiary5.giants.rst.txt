Special Abilities
==================

\ **Eclipse Empowered (Su)**\  When an eclipse giant is in the presence of, and can see, either a solar or a lunar eclipse, it is affected as if subjected to a :ref:`greater heroism <corerulebook.spells.heroism#heroism_greater>`\  spell (CL 20th) for as long as the eclipse lasts. As eclipse giants rarely watch where they're going, they learn to avoid obstacles by instinct; an eclipse giant adds its Wisdom modifier on Reflex saves, even when there is no eclipse.

\ **Imbue Rock (Su)**\  An eclipse giant can imbue a thrown rock, casting either its \ *heal*\  or \ *harm*\  spell-like ability just before it throws the rock. If it imbues the rock with \ *harm*\ , the rock targets touch AC, and a creature hit by the rock attack is also affected as if it were the target of the \ *harm*\  spell. If the giant imbues the rock with \ *heal*\ , any creature that catches the rock with the rock catching special ability is affected as if it were the target of the \ *heal*\  spell. If rocks so imbued either miss the target (in the case of a \ *harm*\ -imbued rock) or are not caught (in the case of a \ *heal*\ -imbued rock) they lose the spell effect.

While these massive giants might appear brutish, they are actually esoteric wanderers and thinkers who take very little notice of the world around them. Instead, their attention is fixated on the heavenly bodies, as they search for the empowering presence of solar or lunar eclipses. While in their search for such cosmological events, eclipse giants are uncaring and may be obliviously destructive, as they are quite large, and they don't watch where they step. While in the presence of an eclipse, however, an eclipse giant becomes truly active, unlocking an inspired inner self that varies from giant to giant. While one eclipse giant might enter a violent frenzy and rage against the world and other creatures, another might produce a fragment of writing that will one day become one of the greatest plays of her generation, and another might solve a complex formula that predicts the celestial movements of the planets.

Eclipse giants stand 40 feet tall and weigh 30,000 pounds.

.. _`bestiary5.giants#eclipse_seer`:

Eclipse Seer
*************

Eclipse seers are able to predict the coming of eclipses. While some believe this knowledge is divinely inspired, in truth most such giants are able to derive the eclipses using mathematical formulas. A typical eclipse seer has the advanced simple template or a few levels in bard, investigator, or wizard (specializing in divination).

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Lunar Aura (Su)**\  Creatures within 60 feet of a moon giant are affected by its lunar aura as long as they remain with range (Will DC 23 negates). The giant can choose one of the following effects.

\ *Waning*\ : Affected creatures are calmed as per \ *calm emotions*\ . Aggressive action against a calmed creature breaks the effect for that creature only. A lycanthrope that fails its save is also affected by the :ref:`true form <advancedplayersguide.spells.trueform#true_form>`\  spell.

\ *Waxing*\ : Affected creatures are enraged as per \ *rage*\ . A lycanthrope that fails its save is also affected by the :ref:`true form <advancedplayersguide.spells.trueform#true_form>`\  spell, except it is forced to revert to its hybrid form instead of its human form.

A creature that succeeds at its save against the aura is immune to that particular moon giant's lunar aura for 24 hours. A moon giant can activate, suppress, or change the effect of the aura as a free action, and the giant can choose whether to include itself as part of the same free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Impact Crater (Ex)**\  When a moon giant throws a rock, it creates an area of difficult terrain in a 10-foot radius around the spot where the rock landed. If the rock was thrown at a creature, the giant can choose the point of origin for this radius anywhere within the target's space. If the moon giant misses with a rock attack, roll to determine where the rock lands as if it were a splash weapon.

\ **Improved Rock Catching (Ex)**\  A moon giant gains rock catching, and it additionally receives a +4 racial bonus on its Reflex save when attempting to catch a thrown rock.

Moon giants dwell in rocky badlands and other scarred, deserted places. They revere the moon, stars, and comets and seek wisdom in these celestial bodies' movements. Though they are normally placid scholars, more likely to enter a lively philosophical debate with other creatures than a brawl, moon giants can become violent when disturbed or when under the influence of a bad moon.

Most moon giants stand about 24 feet tall and weigh almost 18,000 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Solar Aura (Su)**\  Light levels within 60 feet of a sun giant increase by one step (supernatural darkness becomes normal darkness). This does not count as a light effect for the purpose of light and darkness effects; a solar aura is not hindered by any type of magical darkness, and its effect is applied after all light and darkness effects. In areas of bright light, a solar aura causes sighted creatures to become dazzled for as long as they remain in the aura. Once per round as a free action, a sun giant can direct light toward a single target within her solar aura, and that creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Sun Dart (Ex)**\  A sun giant can fire darts of light from her atlatl. She doesn't need ammunition, the sun darts target touch AC, and the sun darts deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. A Large or smaller creature damaged by a sun giant's sun dart becomes entangled and immobilized. A creature can free itself with a successful DC 24 Escape Artist or Strength check as a standard action or by breaking the sun dart (hardness 5, hp 20). The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Sun giants view themselves as soldiers in an eternal war against the forces of darkness and shadow. In ancient days, sun giants were a benevolent people, fighting for the good of all living things. Over time, the majority of sun giants have become selfish, demanding tribute and even blood sacrifices in exchange for the protection they provide, ruling by might and opposed by those few brave and benevolent souls willing to take to the shadows to fight for freedom. Many evil sun giants pay homage to demon lords of the sun and warfare.

Sun giants hold vicious hatred for creatures of pure darkness and denizens of the Plane of Shadow, and they exterminate owbs in particular whenever possible.

Though they live for centuries, sun giants are blessed with eternally youthful appearances, a blessing that remains even for those who become selfish and corrupt. They tower over 25 feet tall and weigh roughly 18,000 pounds.
