Call Lightning
===============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`call lightning <corerulebook.spells.calllightning#call_lightning>`

Each lightning bolt's damage increases to 3d10 points of damage (or 5d10 points outdoors in stormy weather). Half of this damage is electricity damage, and the other half is sonic. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are dazzled and deafened for 1 round. Those that fail at their saving throws are dazzled and deafened for 1 minute.
