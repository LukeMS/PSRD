Meridian Belt
==============

\ **Price**\  1,000 gp; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation; \ **CL**\  9th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a :ref:`ring of protection <corerulebook.magicitems.rings#ring_of_protection>`\ , :ref:`ring of energy resistance <corerulebook.magicitems.rings#ring_of_energy_resistance>`\ , :ref:`ring of swimming <corerulebook.magicitems.rings#ring_of_swimming>`\ , and :ref:`ring of counterspells <corerulebook.magicitems.rings#ring_of_counterspells>`\ , switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.

The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a :ref:`ring of invisibility <corerulebook.magicitems.rings#ring_of_invisibility>`\  is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a :ref:`ring of sustenance <corerulebook.magicitems.rings#ring_of_sustenance>`\ ) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period.

The tail does not grant the wearer any additional attacks or actions per round, nor can it wield weapons, but it can make unarmed attacks and hold or manipulate objects about as well as the wearer's normal limbs (though any activity requiring fingers is beyond the tail's capabilities). The belt can function as a tail for 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive.
