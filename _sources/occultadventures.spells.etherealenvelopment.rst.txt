Ethereal Envelopment
=====================

\ **School**\  conjuration (teleportation); \ **Level**\  psychic 7, spiritualist 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  S, M (empty crystal box)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates, see text; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

This spell is similar to \ *ethereal envelope*\ , but it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it's forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or :ref:`Escape Artist <corerulebook.skills.escapeartist#escape_artist>`\  check leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn't allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the :ref:`ethereal envelope <occultadventures.spells.etherealenvelope#ethereal_envelope>`\  spell description.

If the creature breaks free of the \ *ethereal envelopment*\  or you dismiss the spell, the target is returned to its prior location on the Material Plane, as described for :ref:`ethereal envelope <occultadventures.spells.etherealenvelope#ethereal_envelope>`\ , but if the target is conscious at the time, it doesn't spend a round asleep or staggered.
