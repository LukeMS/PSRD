Special Abilities
==================
\ **Share Defenses (Su)**\  As a free action, a shantak can extend its :ref:`no breath <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#no_breath>`\  ability and :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  :ref:`immunity <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#immunity_(ex_or_su)>`\  to a single creature touching it. It can withdraw this protection as a free action.
\ **Slippery (Ex)**\  A shantak's scales seep slippery slime. This grants the creature a +8 bonus on all :ref:`Escape Artist <corerulebook.skills.escapeartist#escape_artist>`\  checks and to its CMD against grapples, and imparts a –5 penalty on all :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  checks made by creatures attempting to ride a shantak.
\ **Starflight (Su)**\  A shantak can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion)—provided the shantak knows the way to its destination. 
Shantaks speak in a shrill voice that sounds like glass grinding against stone. They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mounts—a would-be shantak rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak's cooperation as a mount, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas.
Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.
A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.
