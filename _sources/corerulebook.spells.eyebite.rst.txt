.. list-table::

   * - HD
     - Effect
   * - 10 or more
     - :ref:`Sickened <corerulebook.glossary#sickened>`
   * - 5â€“9
     - :ref:`Panicked <corerulebook.glossary#panicked>`\ , :ref:`sickened <corerulebook.glossary#sickened>`
   * - 4 or less
     - Comatose, :ref:`panicked <corerulebook.glossary#panicked>`\ , :ref:`sickened <corerulebook.glossary#sickened>`

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.

\ *Sickened*\ : Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. A creature affected by this spell remains :ref:`sickened <corerulebook.glossary#sickened>`\  for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a :ref:`remove disease <corerulebook.spells.removedisease#remove_disease>`\  or :ref:`heal <corerulebook.spells.heal#heal>`\  spell, but a :ref:`remove curse <corerulebook.spells.removecurse#remove_curse>`\  is effective.

\ *Panicked*\ : The subject becomes :ref:`panicked <corerulebook.glossary#panicked>`\  for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains :ref:`shaken <corerulebook.glossary#shaken>`\  for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes :ref:`panicked <corerulebook.glossary#panicked>`\  again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.

\ *Comatose*\ : The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a :ref:`sleep <corerulebook.spells.sleep#sleep>`\  effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

You must spend a swift action each round after the first to target a foe.
