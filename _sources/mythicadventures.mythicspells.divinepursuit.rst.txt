Divine Pursuit
===============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`divine pursuit <ultimatemagic.spells.divinepursuit#divine_pursuit>`

The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increases by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. You gain a bonus on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  and :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  skill checks attempted against the selected creature. This is a sacred bonus if you're good or a profane bonus if you're evil; if you're neutral, choose either the sacred or profane bonus.
