Minor Artifacts
****************

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that can no longer be created, at least by common mortal means.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#beacon_of_true_faith`:

Beacon of True Faith
=====================

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#aura`:

\ **Aura**\  strong (all schools); \ **CL**\  20th

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#slot`:

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#description`:

Description
============

The \ *beacon of true faith*\  takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. The torch holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of especially strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. All of these are command-word activated.

Chaotic (violet flame): :ref:`Word of chaos <corerulebook.spells.wordofchaos#word_of_chaos>`\  once per day on command.

Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of :ref:`protection from evil <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil#protection_from_evil>`\  and :ref:`heroism <corerulebook.spells.heroism#heroism>`\ .

Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of :ref:`protection from good <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromgood#protection_from_good>`\  and may use :ref:`harm <corerulebook.spells.harm#harm>`\  twice per day.

Lawful (golden flame): :ref:`Dictum <corerulebook.spells.dictum#dictum>`\  once per day on command.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#destruction`:

Destruction
============

The \ *beacon of true faith*\  is destroyed if its bearer turns against the worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#hammer_of_thunderbolts`:

Hammer of Thunderbolts
=======================

\ **Aura**\  strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; \ **CL**\  20th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Weight**\  15 lbs.

Description
============

This +3 Large :ref:`returning <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_returning>`\  warhammer deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a :ref:`belt of giant strength <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#belt_of_giant_strength>`\  and knows the weapon is a \ *hammer of thunderbolts*\  (not just the \ *+3 warhammer*\  it appears to be), it becomes a +5 Large giant-bane :ref:`returning <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_returning>`\  :ref:`thundering <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#thundering>`\  warhammer with the following two properties. One, when the bearer hits with the hammer as a thrown attack, it emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's range increment increases to 30 feet.

Destruction
============

A \ *hammer of thunderbolts*\  is destroyed if heated in a fire giant's forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes the iron of the \ *hammer*\  to become so brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike. Only bathing it in a fire giant's blood can reverse its brittleness; once shattered, nothing can do so.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#knucklebone_of_fickle_fortune`:

Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune
==============================

\ **Aura**\  strong (all schools); \ **CL**\  20th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Weight**\  —

Description
============

At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the \ *knucklebone's*\  true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the \ *knucklebone of fickle fortune*\  looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see Table 7–13). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.

This effect is negated if the character rolls the :ref:`knucklebone of fickle fortune <advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#knucklebone_of_fickle_fortune>`\  again before he dies.

Destruction
============

The \ *knucklebone of fickle fortune*\  disappears if its Eha-Zah face (a 20 on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some sages believe that this does not destroy the artifact, and it instead reappears at some random spot in the world, but such knowledge is purely conjecture, for it is not known whether anyone has accomplished this improbable task.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#perfect_golden_lute`:

Perfect Golden Lute
====================

\ **Aura**\  strong transmutation; \ **CL**\  20th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Weight**\  3 lbs.

Description
============

The \ *perfect golden lute*\  is said to be a flawless instrument; its tone and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine it practically performs itself, granting anyone who plays it a +10 competency bonus on :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (string instruments) checks with it. A character with ranks in :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (string instrument) can play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or fascinate (as the bardic performance abilities) as if he were a 1st-level bard, performing a number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier. If the user of the \ *perfect golden lute*\  is a bard, he adds +2 to the DC of all bardic performance abilities using the lute, and can use bardic performance with the lute for an additional 6 rounds per day. 

Destruction
============

The \ *perfect golden lute*\  shatters into splinters if a day passes in which no music is played within 1,000 miles of it, or if its bearer is killed by a bard spell or bardic performance.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#spindle_of_perfect_knowledge`:

Spindle of Perfect Knowledge
=============================

\ **Aura**\  strong transmutation; \ **CL**\  20th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Weight**\  —

Description
============

The \ *spindle of perfect knowledge*\  is large, bright, and flawless marquise-cut diamond :ref:`ioun stone <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#ioun_stones>`\  the size of a halfling's fist. The gemstone would be a treasure in itself if it lacked magic, but it is also a powerful :ref:`ioun stone <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#ioun_stones>`\ . The \ *spindle of perfect knowledge*\  functions like a :ref:`headband of mental superiority <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#headband_of_mental_superiority>`\  +4 and grants 5 ranks in two random :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  skills. The wearer can communicate and understand languages as if using :ref:`comprehend languages <corerulebook.spells.comprehendlanguages#comprehend_languages>`\ , :ref:`tongues <corerulebook.spells.tongues#tongues>`\ , and telepathy with a range of 100 feet.

Destruction
============

The \ *spindle of perfect knowledge*\  is destroyed if worn by a mindless creature for an entire year.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.minorartifacts#talisman_of_reluctant_wishes`:

Talisman of Reluctant Wishes
=============================

\ **Aura**\  strong conjuration; \ **CL**\  20th

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

Description
============

A \ *talisman of reluctant wishes*\  appears the same as a \ *stone of controlling earth elementals*\ , a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a \ *talisman of reluctant wishes*\  must make a DC 15 Charisma check. 

If the check fails, the talisman acts as a :ref:`stone of weight <corerulebook.magicitems.specificcurseditems#stone_of_weight>`\ . Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.

If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.

If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like. 

The artifact grants one :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)

Regardless of which reaction results, a \ *talisman of reluctant wishes*\  disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.

Destruction
============

A \ *talisman of reluctant wishes*\  can be destroyed by wishing it so, using either one of the stone's \ *wishes*\  or a :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  spell from another source. The stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points of damage to the holder.
