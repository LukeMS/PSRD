Gars are predatory fish that live in deep lakes and rivers. Sleek and swift, they regard anything their own size or smaller as food. A typical gar is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds. One species known as the alligator gar can grow to lengths of 10 feet. An alligator gar is a gar with the advanced creature template.

Although typical gars are frightening enough, tales of enormous giant gars that lurk in the deepest rivers and lakes persist in many regions. These creatures are true monsters, often growing to lengths of 30 feet or more and capable of swallowing a horse and rider in a single gulp. Fortunately, giant gars are much rarer than their smaller kin.
Giant gars are often kept as pets and guard animals by aquatic creatures such as merrows, scrags (aquatic trolls), and the rare sea hags who dwell in freshwater dens.
