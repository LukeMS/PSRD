Feather Fall
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`feather fall <corerulebook.spells.featherfall#feather_fall>`

The spell affects one additional target per level. The targets don't have to be within 20 feet of each other.

\ **Augmented (4th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell absorbs the targets' velocity and transforms it into a concussive blast. Targets fall at the normal rate (not slowed) but land safely. When a target lands, it creates a 10-foot-radius burst of force that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d6, Reflex half, DC equal to the DC of :ref:`feather fall <corerulebook.spells.featherfall#feather_fall>`\ ). The targets of this spell are unaffected by these concussive blasts.
