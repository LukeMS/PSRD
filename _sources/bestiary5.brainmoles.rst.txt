Special Abilities
==================

\ **Brain Drain (Su)**\  When a brain mole maintains a grapple against a creature to which it is attached, it automatically deals an amount of damage equal to its bite damage. Whenever a brain mole successfully deals damage to a creature to which it is attached, it drains some of that creature's mental energy. If the creature is a spellcaster, the spellcaster loses a single spell he has prepared, or a single unused spell slot if he is a spontaneous spellcaster. The creature chooses which spell or spell slot is lost, but can't lose a 0-level spell in this way. If the creature is not a spellcaster or has no prepared spells or unused spell slots of 1st-level or higher, this ability instead deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. Either way, the brain mole gains 1 point each of psychic energy each time it uses this ability as long as it drains at least one spell or deals at least 1 point of ability damage.

\ **Second Sight (Su)**\  Brain moles can sense the presence of creatures whose minds have been opened to the world of magic. Brain moles can notice and locate any creature within 60 feet that is capable of casting spells (whether they are arcane, divine, or psychic spells). This functions identically to blindsight, except that it applies only to creatures that can cast spells.

\ **Shrouded Mind (Su)**\  Brain moles are able to psychically shield their minds, allowing them to go undetected by predators that hunt psychically. Brain moles are immune to \ *detect*\  spells as well as spells that read or examine auras.

Unlike regular moles, which survive on earthworms and other mundane fare, brain moles feed on the psychic energy of other creatures, seeking it out with an addict's fervor. Whenever a brain mole encounters a likely victim—preferably a spellcaster—it latches on via its toothy, circular mouth, then magically siphons mental energy until the prey either escapes or falls comatose. After draining energy from a foe, a brain mole usually flees rather than staying to fight, and uses its psychic ability to cast \ *expeditious retreat*\  to aid its escape.

Spellcasters of 5th level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a brain mole as a familiar by taking the :ref:`Improved Familiar <corerulebook.feats#improved_familiar>`\  feat.

Tumorous bulges crisscross this six-limbed rodent, lending its hairless body a bloated, brain-like appearance.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Brain Exchange (Su)**\  Whenever a brain mole monarch successfully deals damage to a creature to which it is attached, it can switch that creature's mind with one of its minions', using its psychic gestalt as a conduit. This ability functions as the :ref:`mind swap <occultadventures.spells.mindswap#mind_swap>`\  spell (Will DC 17 negates), except the brain mole monarch exchanges the creature's mind with one of the other brain moles in its psychic gestalt, not its own.

\ **Monarch Bite (Ex)**\  Whenever a brain mole monarch hits with its bite attack, it automatically grapples its foe. It automatically succeeds at any checks to maintain the grapple in future rounds, and inflicts its bite damage each time it does so. A brain mole monarch treats its CMD as 8 higher for the purposes of determining how hard it is to break free of the grapple while it is attached.

\ **Psychic Gestalt (Su)**\  As a full-round action, a brain mole monarch can form a psychic link with other brain moles within 100 feet, sharing its intellect and gaining the ability to telepathically communicate with and command them. Once the bond is established, members can move further than 100 feet from the brain mole monarch without breaking it, but it ends if they travel to different planes. Brain moles within a psychic gestalt gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and gain access to the brain mole monarch's teamwork feats. Brain mole monarchs gain a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and 2 PE for each brain mole in the gestalt, to a maximum of +6 to Intelligence and 20 additional PE. If any member of the gestalt is aware of a particular danger, they are all aware of that danger. If one member of the gestalt is not flat-footed, none of them are. No member of the gestalt is considered flanked unless all its members are flanked. A brain mole can be in only one psychic gestalt, and a brain mole monarch can't be in a gestalt with another brain mole monarch.

\ **Second Sight (Su)**\  Brain mole monarchs can notice and locate any creature capable of casting spells (whether arcane, divine, or psychic) within 60 feet. This functions identically to thoughtsense, except that it applies only to spellcasting creatures.

\ **Shrouded Mind (Su)**\  Brain mole monarchs psychically shield their minds to protect them from psychic predators. Brain mole monarchs and all members of their gestalts are immune to \ *detect*\  spells as well as spells that read or examine auras.

Brain moles who gorge themselves on psychic energy occasionally find their bodies wracked by magically infused tumors that vastly enhance their intellects and psychic spellcasting but condemn the moles to slow deaths. These individuals, called brain mole monarchs, connect to their fellow brain moles in a psychic hive mind. Most use their newfound mental abilities to attempt to secure a legacy or to provide for their nests once they pass on, and their mad plots become increasingly eccentric and aggressive as the end nears.
