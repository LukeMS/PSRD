Symbol of Fear
===============

\ **School**\  necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates

This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that all creatures within 60 feet of the \ *symbol of fear*\ instead become :ref:`panicked <corerulebook.glossary#panicked>`\  for 1 round per caster level.

\ *Note*\ : Magic traps such as \ *symbol of fear*\ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for \ *symbol of fear*\ .
