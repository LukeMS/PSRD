You gain greater sensitivity to magic associated with your primary spirit and your wandering spirits (any spells on the spirit magic spell lists for these spirits, as well as spell-like abilities that duplicate the effects of those spells). You gain a +10 circumstance bonus on :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  checks to identify these spells if they are cast within the area, and a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws to resist the effects of such spells. If any of these spells require an attack roll, you are never considered flat-footed against such attacks.
