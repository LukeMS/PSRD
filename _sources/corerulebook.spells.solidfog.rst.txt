Solid Fog
==========

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 4

\ **Components**\ : V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)

\ **Duration**\  1 min./level

:ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  no

This spell functions like :ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ , but in addition to obscuring sight, the \ *solid fog*\  is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a \ *solid fog*\  move at half their normal speed and take a â€“2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into \ *solid fog*\  is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in \ *solid fog*\ . \ *Solid fog*\ , and effects that work like \ *solid fog*\ , do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.

Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

\ *Solid fog*\ can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell. A permanent \ *solid fog*\ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
