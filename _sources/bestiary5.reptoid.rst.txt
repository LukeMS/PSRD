Special Abilities
==================

\ **Change Shape (Su)**\  A reptoid can assume the appearance of a specific single Medium humanoid. The reptoid always takes this specific form when it uses this ability. The reptoid gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that type of humanoid. This ability otherwise functions as \ *alter self,*\  except the reptoid does not adjust its ability scores. A reptoid can select a new humanoid form by spending 1 week preparing itself for the change, but can then no longer assume its previous humanoid form.

\ **Mental Potency (Ex)**\  A reptoid's mental effects can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal. Both the Hit Die limit and the total number of Hit Dice affected by each enchantment or illusion spell it casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells it casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). This ability stacks with the mesmerist's ability of the same name.

Reptoids are bipedal reptiles from another planet, or perhaps even another plane—they refuse to reveal their origins to humanoids, even under duress. Disguised as members of others races, the reptoids seek positions of power in order to secretly prepare for an invasion from their homeworld. Even those who are aware of reptoids in their midst can never be truly sure who is real and who is an alien, as these creatures are often adept at enchantment and psychic magic, which they use to cover the tracks of their deceptions and to ensure the complacency or even collusion of their soon-to-be thralls.
