Storm Hag
**********

This hag's hair, claws, and teeth crackle with sparks of electricity. Her windswept hair billows up from her brow like a thunderhead.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Child-Scent (Ex)**\  A storm hag has the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid children and immature animals. Thus, she could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but not the child's parents or the den mother.

\ **Storm Rider (Su)**\  A storm hag is considered two size categories larger for the purpose of wind effects.

\ **Storm Strike (Su)**\  Each time a storm hag makes a successful attack with her bite, claws, or a weapon that is predominantly made of metal, the attack deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.

\ **Whipping Winds (Su)**\  As a standard action, a storm hag can use :ref:`gust of wind <corerulebook.spells.gustofwind#gust_of_wind>`\  to trip her foes. This ability can only affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses her normal CMB. The :ref:`gust of wind <corerulebook.spells.gustofwind#gust_of_wind>`\  doesn't create its normal effects. The trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability does as normal.

When the clouds turn gray and the winds pick up into a howl, wise travelers pray that the cause is only a natural tempest and not a storm hag. A storm hag resembles an old woman with a thundercloud of hair. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed teeth with small arcs of electricity jumping across them. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm hag weighs 70 pounds and stands around 4 feet tall, though if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet.

Storm Hag Covens
*****************

A storm hag is haughty and views her way of doing things as the only proper approach, forcing coven members to ride a fine line between flattery and submission. Coven members gain the child-scent ability as long as they are within 100 feet of the storm hag. In addition, a coven with a storm hag as a member has access to the following additional spell-like abilities: :ref:`call lightning storm <corerulebook.spells.calllightningstorm#call_lightning_storm>`\  (DC 18), :ref:`plague storm <ultimatemagic.spells.plaguestorm#plague_storm>`\  (DC 19), \ *quench*\  (DC 16), \ *whirlwind*\  (DC 21), and :ref:`wind wall <corerulebook.spells.windwall#wind_wall>`\ .
