Silence
========

\ **School**\ illusion (glamer); \ **Level**\ bard 2, cleric 2

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 round

\ **Components**\ V, S

\ **Range**\ long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

\ **Area**\ 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space

\ **Duration**\ 1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ : :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; see text or none (object); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\ : yes; see text or no (object)

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save to negate the spell and can use :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\ , if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\ , but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a \ *silence*\ spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.
