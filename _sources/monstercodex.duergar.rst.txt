Duergar
********

When veterans of campaigns in the deep caverns beneath the world gather, they hiss warnings to those of a mind to brave the world's depths. They speak with horror of the drow and shudder when describing the perversions of the derros, but avoid altogether talk of the gray dwarves and their grim enclaves. It's a difficult subject in the presence of friendly dwarves whose ancestors long ago heard the call of the surface world. The duergar's folly serves as a lesson on the hazards of pride and stubbornness, and lays bare those flaws of the dwarven people.

Clannish, hateful, and malevolent tyrants and slavers, the gray dwarves refuse to accept the consequences of their own actions and the reality of their chosen fate. Instead, they blame everyone else: the orcs, the drow, and especially their own surface-dwelling cousins. They believe—with an iron-hard certainty—that the surface dwarves are the true traitors of their race. But this is all delusion. The duergar are a race enslaved by themselves, the dark powers they called upon for succor, and the lightless labyrinths of their home.

The gray dwarves believe that other creatures are fit only for service and torment. The reasons for this perceived racial supremacy vary slightly from community to community, but the underlying narratives are the same: the strong nature of the duergar has allowed them to stand on their own in the depths, and this strength has forged them into a superior race.

The dwarves have always been people of the earth. In the early days of the world, they mined air-filled spaces miles underground, and the light and skies of the surface were unknown to them. But like all great empires, the doom of this one was written in the stars the dwarves had not yet spied.

The dwarves were lucky, for their gods were good and just, and cared for the welfare of the dwarven people. When the end was nigh, the gods sent warnings and portents, and the mystics and the wise among the race heard the call and warned their kin. But there are always those who doubt. Some cling to the life they know and foolishly think it is their birthright until the end of eternity. Some doubt because it is in their nature, or because they fear others wish to take what is theirs. While great masses of the dwarves headed upward to the new halls on the surface world promised to them, a number stayed behind, proclaiming themselves masters of the ancient dwarven holds.

Less than a generation after the great retreat, the calamities that were foretold came to pass. The once-grand subterranean holds were ripped apart by earthquakes and scorched by magma flows. Those who remained had to flee deeper into the earth in search of pockets of relative safety and calm, competing with an influx of ancient enemies, displaced predators, and unspeakable evils freed from once-sealed vaults deep under the earth. Within only a few years, most of the dwarves left behind had perished, and the survivors were scattered and utterly desperate. In their hour of need, their calls to the old gods were answered only with silence. Such entreaties were nothing more than screams into the darkness... but sometimes the darkness answers back.

According to legend, an outcast dwarven god heard the pleas of those left to suffer. A deceiver and a cheat, this god had lost nearly all of his former followers, but offered these forsaken dwarves one chance for survival: if they worshiped and served him, and bound their descendants to the same fate, he would restore them to glory. Given little choice, the desperate dwarves agreed. The outcast god turned the dwarves' skin ashen gray and caused most of the males' hair (except for eyebrows and beards) to fall out as a reminder of the bargain made, so their gray faces—or \ *duergar*\  in the Dwarven tongue—would set them apart from those cowards who fled the crucible that forged the true members of the dwarven race.

Since that cataclysm and the deal they wrought, the duergar have steadily taken back what was once theirs using the tools of their new lord: murder, slavery, toil, and hatred. Believing themselves the true race of dwarves, they have no interest in the land above other than engaging in occasional raids to murder their cousins or to replenish their stock of slaves. They see themselves as the masters of the only land worth having: the mineral-rich true homeland of the dwarven people.

Duergar believe their society is the ideal state of the dwarves. In many ways, duergar society is like a reflection of dwarven society seen in a distorted mirror. Rivalries are just as fierce, but among the duergar, they can easily end in murder or mutilation. Work is revered, but the duergar's greatest achievements are built on the backs of slaves, many of whom do not survive to see the end results of their toil.

The entire structure of duergar society is based on the sacrifice they made to their outcast god and the repercussions of that deal. Each is a slave to his master, and must submit to a life of toil in order to repay the debt the duergar owe. Of course, that debt can never be repaid, and no rewards for their labor await duergar in the afterlife. This leads them to create works that lack soul or beauty—highly utilitarian, but stark, cold, and lifeless.

Like their hated kin, duergar divide themselves into large kinship clans, forming alliances through marriage. The priesthood stands apart, and arbitrates in legal and familial conflicts. Duergar who enter the clergy are bound to sever their ties with family and clan, but this is rarely the case in practice. Obligations to kin often outweigh priests' sense of duty, resulting in a system of law with very little semblance of justice. Slavish devotion to the faith of their liberator and a strict adherence to the common law are lauded in duergar society, so much so that duergar's word is only rarely broken. In truth, though, a canny gray dwarf uses her words very carefully in order to keep her options flexible. A common duergar expression is "Dealings done within sight are slaves to law; deeds done in secret are slaves only to purpose."

Full statistics for duergar can be found in their :ref:`Bestiary entry <bestiary.duergar>`\ .

New Rules
##########

When the duergar made deals with their dark god to turn the tide against their hated enemies, they were fundamentally changed, both physically and psychologically. After a period of adjustment to their new circumstances, their artisans developed innovations to better cope with their harsh environment, and their spellcasters mastered magical secrets gifted to them by the dark powers that granted them succor during the race's time of direst need.

Alternate Racial Traits
************************

Since the calamity that drove the duergar from their original homes under the earth, the duergar have faced many adversaries. While the duergar may be fiercely traditional and as inflexible as adamantine, their trials, the strange rites of their priests, and the bizarre energies of the remote chambers buried beneath the world have changed them in essential ways. Some duergar have the following racial traits.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#ironskinned`:

\ **Ironskinned**\ : The soul of the earth infuses some duergar, giving them the ability to harden their skin. Duergar with this racial trait can use \ *ironskin*\  once per day as a spell-like ability, using their character level as their caster level. This racial trait replaces the :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  spell-like ability.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#twilight_touched`:

\ **Twilight-Touched**\ : While most duergar have the power to become invisible, a few are instead able to extinguish the light around them. Duergar with this racial trait can use :ref:`dust of twilight <advancedplayersguide.spells.dustoftwilight#dust_of_twilight>`\  once per day as a spell-like ability, using their character level as their caster level. This racial trait replaces the :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\  spell-like ability.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#duergar_feats`:

Duergar Feats
**************

Duergar have access to the following feats.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#gray_dwarf_magic`:

Gray Dwarf Magic
=================

You gain a new spell-like ability from the list of duergar racial traits.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Duergar.

\ **Benefit**\ : Choose one spell-like ability that is usable once per day and is granted by a duergar racial trait you don't have. You can use that spell-like ability once per day, with a caster level equal to your character level.

\ **Special**\ : You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must select a spell-like ability that's usable once per day from a different duergar racial trait.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#innate_flexibility`:

Innate Flexibility
===================

Your innate magic is flexible.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Duergar, two racial spell-like abilities usable once per day.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a number of additional uses of your once per day racial spell-like abilities equal to the number of such abilities you have. You can expend these additional uses in any combination. Normal duergar spell-like abilities and those granted by duergar racial traits both count for the purpose of this feat.

For example, a normal duergar has two once per day spell-like abilities (:ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  and :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\  ), so taking this feat would grant her two additional uses of her once per day spell-like abilities; each day she can use either two additional uses of :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\ , two additional uses of :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\ , or one additional use of each.

\ **Special**\ : You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#tough_as_iron`:

Tough as Iron
==============

Effects that grant natural armor work even better for you.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Toughness <corerulebook.feats#toughness>`\ , duergar.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you gain an enhancement bonus to your natural armor, that bonus increases by 2. This has no effect if your natural armor bonus is +0 or you do not have an enhancement bonus increasing your natural armor bonus.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#duergar_equipment`:

Duergar Equipment
******************

The following weapon and ammunition are used by duergar slavers, who use them to capture non-dwarven slaves and dwarven foes they want to keep alive to torture and question.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#bolas_bolts`:

Bolas Bolts
============

\ **Price**\  20 gp; \ **Type**\  exotic

Bolas bolts are bolas-like projectiles used as ammunition for slaver's crossbows. If you hit a target with a bolas bolt fired from a slaver's crossbow, attempt a trip combat maneuver against your target (don't add your Strength bonus when attempting the combat maneuver check). You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas bolt.

On a critical hit, instead of dealing extra damage, the bolas bolt ensnares its target. Your target is entangled until it or an ally succeeds at a DC 15 Strength check to break the bolas cords. A light slaver's crossbow can entangle a target up to the same size as its intended wielder, and a heavy slaver's crossbow can entangle a creature up to one size larger. A masterwork bolas bolt or one with an enhancement bonus of at least +1 increases the DC of the Strength check to break the bolas to 20.

If the attack trips and entangles a target, the creature cannot move from its square until it breaks free of the bolas cords.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#slaver_crossbow`: `monstercodex.duergar#slavers_crossbow`_

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#slavers_crossbow`:

Slaver's Crossbow
==================

\ **Price**\  varies; \ **Type**\  exotic

\ **Heavy**\ : \ *Weight*\  12 lbs.; \ *Price*\  400 GP

\ **Light**\ : \ *Weight*\  6 lbs.; \ *Price*\  250 GP

This crossbow shoots ammunition called bolas bolts instead of crossbow bolts. It comes in both light and heavy varieties (but not double, hand, or repeating crossbow varieties) with the same reload action as a conventional crossbow of its type.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#duergar_spells`:

Duergar Spells
***************

The following spells are known and were likely developed by duergar spellcasters.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#control_vermin`:

Control Vermin
===============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  cleric 3, druid 2, ranger 4, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF/M (a beetle)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  up to 1 HD/level of vermin, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You and a number of allies less than or equal to your caster level designated upon casting can use :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  and :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  checks to influence or control the targeted vermin as if they were animals and had animal-level intelligence.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#dust_ward`:

Dust Ward
==========

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6

\ **Casting Time**\  10 minutes

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a pinch of pumice)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one magic item

\ **Duration**\  permanent

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You ward a magic item against other creatures who try to learn to use or copy it. When you cast the spell, you designate one creature type, subtype, or a specific individual. If the item is worn or carried for 1 continuous hour or more by a creature that doesn't match the designation, the \ *dust ward*\  disintegrates the item into worthless gray dust. This destruction also occurs if the creature attempts to study the item in order to learn its properties or how to magically craft it (a :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\  or :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  spell used on the gray dust can still reveal this information). The destruction of the item doesn't harm the creature wearing or carrying the item (although the item's destruction may put the creature in harm's way, such as if a magical rope were being used to cross a chasm at the time). If the offending creature wears or carries the item for less than 1 hour and passes it to a different creature, the countdown to the item's destruction starts over.

The spell cannot affect a magic item with a caster level greater than half your caster level.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#ironskin`:

Ironskin
=========

\ **School**\  transmutation [earth]; \ **Level**\  alchemist 2, antipaladin 2, bloodrager 2, cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF/M (a pinch of forge soot)

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D; see text)

Your skin hardens and takes on the color and texture of rough iron. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your existing natural armor bonus (if you do not have a natural armor bonus, you are considered to have an effective natural armor bonus of +0). This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels above 4th, to a maximum of +7 at 15th level.

While you're under the effects of this spell, if an opponent confirms a critical hit or sneak attack against you with a physical weapon (not a spell or magical effect), you can dismiss this spell to negate the critical hit or sneak attack and treat it is as a normal hit. Dismissing the spell in this way is not an action, but you must be conscious and aware of the attack to do so.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#duergar_magic_item`:

Duergar Magic Item
*******************

The following magic item was created by the duergar to aid in the controlling of their vermin mounts.

.. _`monstercodex.duergar#headband_of_vermin_control`:

Headband of Vermin Control
===========================

\ **Price**\  1,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  headband; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation

The wearer of this black leather headband can spend 10 minutes attuning the headband to one touched vermin of Medium or larger size. Once the headband is attuned, any creature wearing it can attempt :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  and :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  checks to influence or control that vermin as if it were an animal and had animal-level intelligence. The attunement lasts until the vermin dies, the headband is destroyed, or the headband is attuned to a different vermin.

Duergar-created items of this type are usually protected by a \ *dust ward*\  \* spell.

A duergar bombardier spends her days fiddling with reagents and bizarre ingredients that she either finds deep underground or purchases from scouts who have brought them back from the surface or distant caverns. Essential ingredients, especially plants, can be hard to find, and a bombardier must work for money or favors if she's to continue practicing her craft.

Though the military and slavers are loath to employ these unpredictable duergar, bombardiers can be very effective when subtlety is not required. Though most bombardiers wouldn't hurt their own kind—the bonds of kin and law are too strong—they often inadvertently kill potential slaves instead of capturing them.

Because religious doctrine is so influential in duergar society, common duergar treat high priests like the voice of their god, trusting their wisdom in all things. A high priest is effectively the primary lawmaker for her clan.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Selective Mind (Su)**\ : To anyone but duergar, these beetles count as mindless. Duergar can affect them with mind-affecting effects, and train and control them as if the beetles were animals.

One duergar steers a juggernaut while two riders attack.

Encounters
###########

Most duergar are encountered deep under the earth, patrolling their territory, hunting for fresh slaves, or bringing back riches from veins of ore and precious stones. Duergar rarely venture to the surface; they typically do so only when they have an opportunity to capture powerful slaves or to attack dwarves who settle above a duergar stronghold.

Duergar Slave Hunters (CR 11)

Searching on the surface after twilight or hidden away from the accursed sky, these slavers move through the shadows quickly and with relative stealth until they find their prey.
