Breath of Life
===============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`breath of life <corerulebook.spells.breathoflife#breath_of_life>`

The spell heals 5d12 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). It can revive a creature that died of hp damage within the past 2 rounds. If the target was slain by a death effect that allows a saving throw, this spell allows the creature to attempt another save against that effect. If this save is successful, the creature is revived with â€“10 hp plus the amount healed by this spell.

\ **Augmented (9th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can target up to one creature per caster level within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can target one creature that has been dead for a number of rounds up to your caster level.
