Ki Leech
=========

\ **School**\  necromancy [evil]; \ **Level**\  cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D)

You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can steal some of that creature's \ *ki*\ . This replenishes 1 point of \ *ki*\  as long as you have at least 1 \ *ki*\  point in your \ *ki*\  pool. This does not allow you to exceed your \ *ki*\  pool's maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the steal \ *ki*\  ability of the :ref:`hungry ghost monk <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.monk#hungry_ghost_monk>`\ ).

This spell has no effect if you do not have a :ref:`ki <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.monk#ki_pool>`\  pool.
