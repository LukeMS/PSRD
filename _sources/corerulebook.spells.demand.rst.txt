Demand
=======

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 8

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  partial; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

This spell functions like :ref:`sending <corerulebook.spells.sending#sending>`\ , but the message can also contain a :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\  (see the :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\  spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save negates the :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\  effect but not the contact itself. The \ *demand,*\ if received, is understood even if the subject's :ref:`Intelligence <corerulebook.gettingstarted#intelligence>`\  score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the \ *demand*\ is issued, the message is understood but the :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\  is ineffective.

The \ *demand*\ 's message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\ . The creature can also give a short reply immediately.
