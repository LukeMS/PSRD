A :ref:`protective spirit <advancedplayersguide.spells.protectivespirit#protective_spirit>`\  is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the :ref:`protective spirit <advancedplayersguide.spells.protectivespirit#protective_spirit>`\  makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A :ref:`protective spirit <advancedplayersguide.spells.protectivespirit#protective_spirit>`\  can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.
