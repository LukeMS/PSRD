Decrepit Disguise
==================

\ **School**\  illusion (glamer); \ **Level**\  bard 1, medium 1, mesmerist 1, occultist 1, psychic 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one object of no more than 10 cu. ft./level

\ **Duration**\  1 day/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none (object) or Will disbelief (if interacted with); \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You make an object seem like a worthless version of itself. A masterwork or magic sword could seem to be a useless, rusting, discarded blade, and a luxurious throne could appear to be a decrepit wooden chair. If used against an attended object, the wielder can immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. \ *decrepit disguise*\  counters and dispels :ref:`quintessence <occultadventures.spells.quintessence#quintessence>`\ .

\ *Decrepit disguise*\  can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency>`\  spell by a caster of 9th level or higher for the cost of 500 gp.
