Climbing Beanstalk
===================

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  druid 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Effect**\  5-ft. square of climbable beanstalks

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

You cause a thick, sturdy beanstalk to sprout from the ground and grow upward to a height of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. The growing stalk anchors itself to sturdy objects such as walls or ceilings, and grows around objects that do not fully obstruct its square (such as tree branches), but is stopped by solid obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds (:ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  DC 5). The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level, or double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a sturdy mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free requires a DC 23 Strength check or cutting through the beanstalk (hardness 2, hp 40).

If the ground is capable of supporting plant life, the beanstalk continues to live as a normal plant, and it produces nutritious (if unappetizing) beans. Otherwise, the plant dies after 1d6 hours; its husk remains as durable as a small tree.
