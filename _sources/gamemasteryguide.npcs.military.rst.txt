Military
#########
Trained soldiers might take up arms for nearly any cause imaginable. Whether the champions of heroic kingdoms fighting off monstrous legions or the denizens of a bleak realm invading their neighbors, vast legions arise to do the will of lords both fair and foul. Yet the real strength of such soldiers lies not in personal skill, but in sheer numbers or deftly implemented tactics. Professional combatants might also find a variety of roles beyond the battlefield, whether as guardians, raiders, or even adventurers.

\ **Boon**\  Foot soldiers can help PCs buy normal (non-masterwork) simple or martial weapons at a 10% discount, or may agree to accompany the PCs as men-at-arms for a 10% share of the treasure.
Foot soldiers are the backbone of any army, stout soldiers who "hold the line" in the face of the enemy's charge with a bristling wall of pikes, decimate an opposing force's ranks with a hail of javelins, or hew with their swords in the bloody grind of close combat. Foot soldiers close the gap when their foes try to flee the field, and are tough enough to shrug off blows that would fell a common man.
Changing a foot soldier's character class from warrior to fighter creates a professional veteran soldier. This necessitates a number of changes, the foremost of which is using the heroic numbers for his ability scores. In addition, the foot soldier receives a bonus fighter feat such as :ref:`Combat Reflexes <corerulebook.feats#combat_reflexes>`\ , :ref:`Power Attack <corerulebook.feats#power_attack>`\ , or :ref:`Weapon Focus <corerulebook.feats#weapon_focus>`\ .
Different varieties of foot soldier can be easily created by exchanging weapons and armor. For example, replacing the longspear and greatsword with a shortspear, longsword, and heavy steel shield increases the foot soldier's AC by 2.
Foot soldiers can serve as bodyguards or hired muscle for mid-level NPCs, or as the rank-and-file guards at a city gate, in front of a temple, or manning a castle's walls.
Foot soldiers are usually found in squads of six (CR 3), sometimes accompanied by a guard sergeant (CR 4).

\ **Boon**\  Cavalry can offer to train an animal at no cost, or to help PCs buy a combat trained animal at a 10% discount.
Cavalry are the pursuit and shock troops of professional armies, relying on speed and reach to savage the flanks of enemy formations while protecting their mounts, or running down and grinding underfoot enemies who become isolated from their fellows. They are also skilled mounted archers, firing volleys of arrows at opposing forces, then riding out of range of return fire.
Cavalry make excellent royal couriers, elite guards for nobility, well-equipped scouts and outriders for an army, or knights errant more interested in gold and glory than chivalry. 
A single cavalryman may travel with a squad of six foot soldiers (CR 6) or lead a troop of four caravan guards (CR 7). Cavalry are usually grouped in lances of four (CR 9), often with a guide or knight officer (CR 10). Four or five cavalry might also serve as a mounted honor guard for a mayor, noble, or merchant prince (CR 11 or 12).

\ **Boon**\  Generals can provide access to trustworthy mercenary troops. A character with :ref:`Leadership <corerulebook.feats#leadership>`\  gains a +2 bonus to :ref:`Leadership <corerulebook.feats#leadership>`\  for recruiting followers for 1 month. Other PCs can hire mercenaries at a 20% discount.
Generals are the masters of the battlefield, expert and veteran soldiers who conceive and execute tactical plans and inspire their troops on to victory. Generals may command from a rearward vantage point, but when needed, may dive into the fray with sword in hand to turn the tide through sheer puissance. Generals can be used as arena champions, masters of fighting schools, or elite warriors trained to fight with or against spellcasters. A general is usually accompanied by a knight adjutant, with a lance of four cavalry as bodyguards and messengers (CR 12).
