Break Enchantment
==================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`break enchantment <corerulebook.spells.breakenchantment#break_enchantment>`

Against non-mythic effects, the spell automatically succeeds without requiring a caster level check. Against mythic effects, add your tier to your caster level check. The maximum level of spell this spell can remove is 5 + half your tier.

\ **Augmented (7th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can apply a removed enchantment, transmutation, or curse to the creature that originally cast it. The creature must be a valid target of the spell and on the same plane as you, and it gets a saving throw at the effect's original DC.
