Creating a Half-Fiend
**********************

"Half-fiend" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with an Int score of 4 or more. A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

\ **CR**\ : HD 4 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.

\ **Alignment**\ : Any evil.

\ **Type**\ : The creature's type changes to :ref:`outsider <bestiary.creaturetypes#outsider>`\  (native). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

\ **Armor Class**\ : Natural armor improves by +1.

\ **Defenses/Qualities**\ : Gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to poison; acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to creature's CR + 11 (maximum 35).

\ **Speed**\ : Unless the base creature flies better, the half-fiend flies at twice the base creature's land speed (good).

\ **Melee**\ : A half-fiend gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. Damage depends on its size (see pages 301–302).

\ **Special Attacks**\ :  A half-fiend gains the following.

 \ *Smite Good (Su)*\ : Once per day, as a swift action, the half-fiend can smite good as the smite evil ability of a paladin of the same level as its Hit Dice, except affecting a good target. The smite persists until the target is dead or the half-fiend rests. 

 \ *Spell-Like Abilities*\ : A half-fiend with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. CL equals the creature's HD (or the CL of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).

\ **Abilities**\ : A half-fiend gains a +4 bonus on three ability scores of its choice and a +2 bonus on the other three.
