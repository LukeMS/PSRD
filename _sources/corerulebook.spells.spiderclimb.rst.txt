Spider Climb
=============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a live spider)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  10 min./level

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A \ *spider climbing*\ creature retains its :ref:`Dexterity <corerulebook.gettingstarted#dexterity>`\  bonus to :ref:`Armor Class <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
