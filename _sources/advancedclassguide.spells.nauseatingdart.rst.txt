Nauseating Dart
================

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation) [poison]; \ **Level**\  druid 1, witch 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  S, DF

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Effect**\  one poisonous stinger

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude partial (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You spit a poisonous stinger around the size of a quill at a creature within range, as though you had fired a dart from a blowgun. You must succeed at a ranged attack to hit your target. The stinger deals 1d2 points of piercing damage and poisons the target, causing it to become nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
