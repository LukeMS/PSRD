Shield of Law
==============

\ **School**\  abjuration [lawful]; \ **Level**\  cleric 8

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, F (a reliquary worth 500 gp)

\ **Range**\  20 ft.

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and \ *slowing*\ chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike :ref:`protection from chaos <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromchaos#protection_from_chaos>`\ , this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as :ref:`protection from chaos <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromchaos#protection_from_chaos>`\  does.

Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is \ *slowed*\ (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save negates, as the :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  spell, but against \ *shield of law*\ 's save DC).
