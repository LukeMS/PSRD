Special Abilities
==================

\ **Icewalking (Ex)**\  A :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  rider and any creature it rides can move across icy surfaces without penalty and do not need to make :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to run or charge on ice. They may climb icy surfaces as if under the effects of the :ref:`spider climb <corerulebook.spells.spiderclimb#spider_climb>`\  spell.

\ **Implements of Ice (Su)**\  A :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  rider wears full plate armor and wields a +2 :ref:`icy burst <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_icy_burst>`\  glaive made of magical ice as hard as steel. Its armor does not restrict it in any way. When a :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  rider dies, its armor and glaive melt into :ref:`water <bestiary.creaturetypes#water_subtype>`\  in 1d6 rounds.

\ **Susceptible to Shatter (Ex)**\  A :ref:`shatter <corerulebook.spells.shatter#shatter>`\  spell deals 3d6 points of damage to a :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  rider (no save) and reduces its armor bonus by 2 for 1 minute. :ref:`Shatter <corerulebook.spells.shatter#shatter>`\  spells automatically overcome a :ref:`cold <bestiary.creaturetypes#cold_subtype>`\  rider's spell :ref:`resistance <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#resistance>`\ .

Cold riders are terrifying armored majesties, clad in cloaks of frost with a pair of large crystal-blue antlers cresting their almost skeletal heads. Their icy armor and weapons are as much a part of them as their frozen flesh. Cold riders delight in perversion, slaughter, and the corruption of other fey. They prefer undead or cold-resistant steeds, but even when they have no access to such, their phantom steed spell-like ability ensures they never go long without a mount. 

Cold riders are 7 feet tall, though their antlers easily add another 2 feet to their height. They weigh 300 pounds.
