Special Abilities
==================
\ **Lava Body (Ex)**\  The magma :ref:`ooze <bestiary.creaturetypes#ooze>`\  is formed of molten rock. Whenever a creature strikes a magma :ref:`ooze <bestiary.creaturetypes#ooze>`\  with a weapon, that weapon takes 4d6 points of :ref:`fire <bestiary.creaturetypes#fire_subtype>`\  damage unless the attacker makes a DC 19 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does help prevent some of the damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based.
\ **Vulnerability to Water (Ex)**\  A significant amount of water, such as that created by a :ref:`create water <corerulebook.spells.createwater#create_water>`\  spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water :ref:`elemental <bestiary.creaturetypes#elemental_subtype>`\ , that strikes a magma :ref:`ooze <bestiary.creaturetypes#ooze>`\  forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. A magma :ref:`ooze <bestiary.creaturetypes#ooze>`\  that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (this DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or become petrified, reverting once the water is gone.
Magma oozes are living pools of molten rock. They roam the borders of the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire, and on the Material Plane they sometimes arise spontaneously from strange magic, usually in the vicinity of volcanoes. Magma oozes avoid water, and if forced into enough of it, they become encased in a cooled stony shell, unharmed but immobilized, waiting indefinitely until the water retreats.
A typical magma ooze grows to 10 feet across and is about 6 inches thick.

Variant Magma Oozes
********************
Differing types of molten stone and the nature of the magic that created them can influence what types of magma ooze form.

.. _`bestiary2.magmaooze#brimstone`:

\ **Brimstone**\ : Influenced by fiendish energy, brimstone magma oozes stink of evil, and the patterns of cooled stone and hot lava on their surfaces resemble tortured or demonic faces. They have the fiendish creature simple template.

.. _`bestiary2.magmaooze#crystalline`:

\ **Crystalline**\ : Formed from rock densely laced with rare minerals, crystalline magma oozes have hot gases trapped within their bodies. Striking a crystalline magma ooze with a non-reach melee weapon causes this gas to erupt, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage to the attacking creature.

.. _`bestiary2.magmaooze#poisonous`:

\ **Poisonous**\ : Whether from toxic metals or magical contamination, these oozes are deadly poison in addition to mobile burning death. A poisonous ooze is +1 CR.

.. _`bestiary2.magmaooze#magma_ooze_poison`:

Magma Ooze :ref:`Poison <corerulebook.spells.poison#poison>`\ : Slam—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 19; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d2 Con; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.
