Fleshworm Infestation
======================

\ **School**\  conjuration (summoning) [evil]; \ **Level**\  cleric 4, inquisitor 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude partial (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target's flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. \ *Fleshworm infestation*\  cannot be ended early by :ref:`remove disease <corerulebook.spells.removedisease#remove_disease>`\  or :ref:`heal <corerulebook.spells.heal#heal>`\ , as the infestation starts anew if the current worms are slain. :ref:`Protection from evil <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil#protection_from_evil>`\  negates this spell's effects for as long as the two durations overlap. :ref:`Dispel evil <corerulebook.spells.dispelevil#dispel_evil>`\  automatically ends a \ *fleshworm infestation*\ .
