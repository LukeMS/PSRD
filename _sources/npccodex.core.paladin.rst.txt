.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#tactics`:

Tactics
========

\ **During Combat**\  The paladin begins with Dazzling Display, then uses smite evil on the strongest evil opponent. If he is confident he will win the battle, he continues to demoralize opponents.

The callous rake is a young paladin exhibiting unpaladinlike behavior. If unchecked, these habits become the first step toward disgrace.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#tristram_reis`:

Tristram Reis
==============

Tall, lean, and exceedingly handsome, Tristram Reis is the vision of a true and noble paladin—until he opens his mouth. The son of a lesser noble, he has faith in the goddess of valor, but is a bit arrogant and enamored with his own status as a holy warrior.

Honorable outcasts are far from their homes and often found alone. Some have been questing in the wild for so long that they have lost any semblance of social graces and tact.

Haughty avengers often serve as diplomats and bodyguards.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#nyalil_stormstrike`:

Nyalil Stormstrike
===================

Nyalil sees herself as a full elf, not a half-breed. She so thoroughly rejects her human side that she treats humans as lesser creatures—but can be so charming that humans often love her anyway.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Nyalil is often in the company of elven knights, wizards, and priests, who only halfway accept her.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Nyalil is both charming and arrogant, and her words are often a stream of veiled insultsand clever quips, especially when she's dealing with humans.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#skirmishing_crusader`:

A skirmishing crusader often serves as a scout in the army of a noble, or roams the boundaries of civilization, working with rangers to hold the line against evil. She spends her life in the wilds, and as a result can often be awkward and crass.

 1st—:ref:`bless weapon <corerulebook.spells.blessweapon#bless_weapon>`\ , :ref:`cure light wounds <corerulebook.spells.curelightwounds#cure_light_wounds>`

Tactics
========

\ **During Combat**\  The paladin uses her bow to smite evil before it can reach her. She uses cover and her mobility to maintain an advantage over her opponents.

Statistics
===========

\ **Str**\  10, \ **Dex**\  18, \ **Con**\  11, \ **Int**\  10, \ **Wis**\  12, \ **Cha**\  14

Few expect honorable archers to be paladins, since they do not fit the typical image. Other paladins sometimes look down on these archers for shunning close combat, but they care only about efficiency in protecting their flocks.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#tregor_the_just`:

Tregor the Just
================

Tregor believes himself to be a good soul trapped in a body of filth. The half-orc hates his orc heritage, and though he does not know the circumstances of his birth—he was left on the doorstep of a temple—he doubts it was honorable. Raised by the temple priests, Tregor is the shining example of the paladin ideal, as perfect in discipline and purity as he is ugly in appearance. He constantly seeks to better himself and the world by performing heroic deeds, but though he is stalwart and true, his worldview can be aggravatingly black and white .

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Tregor is usually encountered riding his horse, seeking those who need a champion. He questions everyone he meets on the road, and assures them that they have nothing to fear from him—so long as their spirits are pure. 

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Tregor tries to be honest, just, and hospitable, but has no tolerance for evil or cruelty, nor much of a sense of humor.

These paladins often serve as guards, or administer justice for judges and merchants who perform good works for the god of cities. Often, entire units of these paladins are formed to protect holy places in large cities.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#delphos_hesara`:

Delphos Hesara
===============

Delphos comes from a long line of paladins in service to his home city. Despite his low tolerance for the city's corruption, Delphos would rather frighten, disarm, or subdue foes than kill them. He knows one dead body can create a war between powerful or desperate families, and peace is better served by the judicious use of force. The soldiers under his command either love him or hate him. Delphos tries to be harsh but fair, and believes that strict discipline and an organized system of punishments create better guardians. Such punishments take the form of extra duties or unpleasant posts. All punishments for his guards remain within his order—public shaming leads to disrespect and undermines their authority.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  While on duty, Delphos typically commands a contingent of his soldiers, but he can sometimes be found alone on the streets of his city. He roams the neighborhoods around the temple of his god, seeking to keep the areas around the holy place safe. 

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  When Delphos encounters strangers, he treats them with care, but also curiosity. He goes out of his way to avoid confrontation, but when that is not possible, he rarely backs down. He might deputize adventurers for special tasks that soldiers can't do in the open, such as tracking down corrupt merchants dealing in contraband.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#kelgul_klagan`:

Kelgul Klagan
==============

Those who think that a dwarf cannot become an exquisite equestrian should not speak that opinion within earshot of Kelgul Klagan. He is called "the Klager" by his companions and subordinates, a mix of his family name and the sound of his mount's clattering hooves. He commands his soldiers from horseback, and those who know of him joke that he leaves his horse only to drink, sleep, and relieve himself—and maybe not always then. When they talk about his combat prowess, or when the dwarf himself is near, the joking ends, for he is a juggernaut of metal and divine fury, stern-faced and unforgiving in the face of evil and injustice. Kelgul uses few words, even for a dwarf. When in combat, though, he barks orders and expects them to be followed, even by those not under his direct command.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Kelgul is typically encountered with a group of his soldiers. If he has reason to believe the PCs are up to no good, he orders his troops to attack and take the PCs prisoner. If his soldiers are outmatched, he charges forward to rally them and to smite the most powerful enemy.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Kelgul is quiet, and content to stay out of diplomatic endeavors. When he is inclined to speak, he is surprisingly soft-spoken and courteous, though it is hard to tell whether his politeness is sincere or merely what he considers formally appropriate. Those who mistake this for weakness, however, soon learn the folly of their assumptions.

==================

When she was only 8 years old, Telthor's entire village was consumed by dragon fire, but she was found unharmed in the rubble by priests of the goddess of valor. Seeing her survival as a miracle, the priests adopted her. For years, she suffered from terrible nightmares of fire and leathery wings. Since killing her first dragon, however, she has not had a single nightmare.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Telthor prefers to hunt alone, and might attempt to drive off anyone she thinks is unworthy of battling dragons with her. She refuses to let anyone turn her aside when she has a dragon in her path, though she is honorable and grants quarter if asked.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Telthor is quiet and suspicious, believing there are spies everywhere working for the dragons.

A rider of the steppe works individually or in a group to bring safety and law to the wild and arid flatlands, often protecting caravans and traveling dignitaries.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#leisair_truemark`:

Leisair Truemark
=================

Leisair traveled to the steppes in search of peace and tranquility. Instead, she found a place where raiders hunted caravans with impunity, and she decided that this place needed her far more than her homeland. She travels the wastes, often latching on to caravans as a scout.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  An encounter with Leisair typically begins with warning shots. She is not opposed to opening a dialogue with a group, but even then she shouts from far away rather than risk approaching strangers.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  To her friends and the people she protects, Leisair is both friendly and kind, but if she has any reason to suspect the intentions of unknown folks, she can be cold and haughty.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#neln_belgurorn`:

Neln Belgurorn
===============

All gnomes have obsessions, but few are as grim as Neln's obsession to see the world rid of evil giants. Her interest in this goal is neither cheerful nor curious; she has simply seen far too many villages destroyed and lives ruined by giant attacks. She sees it as her sworn duty to hunt and kill these evil beings so they cannot murder or enslave anyone else. So single-minded is her quest against giants that other gnomes have joked she must have dwarven blood in her ancestry. Since she respects dwarven tenacity and toughness, she takes this as a compliment.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Neln is commonly in the company of dwarves who share her desire to see the destruction of giant strongholds, and neither she nor her allies let anyone stand in their way. She sees those who protect giants as being as culpable as giants themselves—perhaps even worse, as they should know better.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Often frowning and stoic, Neln is not like other gnomes. Her lust for life and its experiences is dampened by her bloody quest.

.. _`npccodex.core.paladin#velj_thundari`:

Velj Thundari
==============

Velj Thundari feels at home only when riding a horse, and always seeks to improve his horsemanship. He spends so much time training with his steed that he often has a hard time interacting with people. Unlike his mount, people don't automatically react to his commands (especially since many of these are nonverbal cues),and he often sees their confusion as opposition. Commoners easily frustrate him, which makes him react with sarcasm. He values those people who see his wisdom, however, and is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to keep them safe.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Velj is comfortable fighting alone, leading a charge of mounted knights, or breaking through a wall of enemy defenders to reach their leader. If he grows frustrated with a PC, he might challenge that character to face him a nonlethal duel.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\ Velj is proud of his accomplishments and his paladin code. He becomes angry if he or his life's path is insulted.

Hellin Tallhallow
==================

Short, stout for a halfling, and powerful, Hellin sees himself as the quintessential paladin—and does not suffer fools who doubt his prowess or speak condescendingly about his size. Most of the time he is a cheerful defender of everything lawful and good, but he is quick to anger if small folk or innocents are threatened, abused, or mocked.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Hellin picks fights with slavers or slave owners, even in lands where slavery is legal or ignored. In his mind, those who turn a blind eye are just as guilty as those who forge the chains.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Hellin may need assistance with freeing or protecting a particularly large band of slaves.
