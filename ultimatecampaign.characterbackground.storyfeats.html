<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-story-feats"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Story Feats</a><a class="headerlink" href="#story-feats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A story feat reflects a goal—often an all-consuming one—that shapes your life. Each story feat incorporates a trigger event (which comes from either a campaign occurrence or your background), an immediate benefit, a goal, and a further benefit for achieving that goal.</p>
<p>Story feats are marked with the story keyword. Each feat has at least two possible prerequisites, representing conditions most likely met during play or a background that fits the feat. You need to meet only one of these prerequisites. Anytime you gain a new feat, you may take a story feat, but you can have only one uncompleted story feat at a time. Story feats are designed for PCs, but can be taken by NPCs and monsters as well.</p>
<p>Unlike typical feats, story feats have nebulous prerequisites, and you should chose one only after talking with the GM. The GM should weave a story feat into the greater story of the campaign and even adjust it as needed to fit the campaign’s long-term goals and the specifics of your background. Story feats should work organically within the story of the campaign, rather than be chosen purely for their mechanical benefits.</p>
<p>Like the prerequisites, the completion conditions for a story feat might require GM adjudication. If the events of the campaign are not likely to resolve the story implied by the story feat, the GM should consider shifting the goal to something you can achieve. Establishing a meaningful story arc is more important than adhering to the letter of the feat.</p>
<p>Because a story feat represents both your motivation and character development, the GM should make an effort to incorporate elements related to the feat into the ongoing campaign. These can be direct elements, like the appearance of a villain or hated creature, or indirect elements, such as rumors of the fate of a lost relative or NPCs who are impressed by a PC’s artistic endeavors. A good rule of thumb is to work in a reference to each PC’s story feat once every three to five sessions.</p>
<p>In most cases, allies can assist in completing a story feat. At the GM’s discretion, if you do not take a leadership role in tasks or conflicts related to your own story feat, you might need to complete additional goals to resolve the story feat, or might even be denied completion altogether.</p>
<div class="section" id="common-rules">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-common-rules"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Common Rules</a><a class="headerlink" href="#common-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many story feats share similar terminology in their prerequisites and completion conditions. The following terms have special meanings when used in story feats.</p>
<p><strong>Appropriate Number</strong>: These are either creatures whose individual CRs add up to 20, or creatures whose individual CRs add up to 5 times your character level, whichever is greater. For example, if you’re at 6th level, an appropriate number of creatures have CRs that add up to 30. This calculation is based on your current character level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. Overly easy challenges (encounters with CRs of 3 or more below your character level) don’t count unless circumstances make them much more difficult to handle.</p>
<p><strong>Challenging Foe</strong>: This is a foe or group of foes with a total CR of 10 or a CR of 3 plus your character level, whichever is higher. If this refers to a distinct individual, the foe’s CR is set when the feat is taken, but the foe advances in power as you do. Otherwise, it refers to your current level. A typical recurring foe advances in CR by 1 for every 1—2 levels you gain.</p>
<p><strong>Character’s Level</strong>: Normally, this is your actual character level. If you’re a creature best represented by CR rather than character level (such as most monsters with more than 1 HD), use your calculated CR instead of your character level.</p>
<p><strong>Decisively Defeat</strong>: You overcome a foe in some way, such as by killing the creature, knocking it unconscious, or causing it to be taken prisoner. You must be a significant participant in the conflict to defeat the opponent, even if another strikes the final blow. Whether or not merely causing the enemy to flee qualifies is up to the GM. Generally, driving off an enemy while causing little actual harm does not qualify as a decisive defeat.</p>
<p><strong>Slay</strong>: Slaying a foe includes killing it, destroying it, turning it to stone, banishing it to the Abyss, or otherwise eliminating it in a fashion reversible only by powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, you must deal the final blow yourself to slay a creature.</p>
<p><strong>Thwart</strong>: Distinct from defeating a foe, thwarting a foe involves disrupting its plans in a substantial and essentially permanent fashion. Deposing a lord, bringing down a priest’s temple, or banishing a sorcerer to the depths of Hell all qualify as thwarting. You keep any benefits gained by thwarting a foe even if it survives defeat and returns more powerful than before. You must be a significant participant in the events that lead to your foe being thwarted for your actions to count toward fulfilling a story requirement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="story-feats-and-stacking">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-story-feats-and-stacking"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Story Feats and Stacking</a><a class="headerlink" href="#story-feats-and-stacking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most story feat bonuses are untyped, and stack with almost any other bonus. However, if you have multiple story feats, their untyped bonuses do not stack with each other. For example, if two story feats gave you a bonus on saving throws, you would add only the higher bonus.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accursed-story">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-accursed-story"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Accursed (Story)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#accursed-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your curse weighs down your soul like a millstone around your neck.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must carry a curse that can be lifted only by a quest or similar great undertaking, or have the Cursed Birth background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level, as the curse interferes with all magic. Unlike most spell resistance, it can’t voluntarily be lowered, though your own spells and magic items still automatically affect you.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Your curse is lifted or you are able to purge the corruption of your fiendish blood (the circumstances of either vary widely based on the nature of the curse, and are up to the GM).</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You lose the spell resistance described above. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your character level, but only against harmful enchantment, necromancy, and transmutation spells and spell-like abilities—your aura resists further attempts to curse you. Harmless spells automatically bypass this spell resistance whether you desire it or not. This spell resistance can be voluntarily lowered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arisen-story">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-arisen-story"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Arisen (Story)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#arisen-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills you with a need for answers.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have been slain and brought back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed Birth background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You don’t die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Normal</strong>: You die when your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than your Constitution score.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity’s chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon—a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM’s choice.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="battlefield-healer-story">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-battlefield-healer-story"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Battlefield Healer (Story)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#battlefield-healer-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In even the fiercest battles, you risk life and limb to save your allies.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must successfully cast a conjuration (healing) spell on an ally after being hit by an attack of opportunity, or have the Battle, Chaplain, or Healed background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When attempting a concentration check caused by receiving damage (including ongoing damage), you reduce the damage taken by 50% for the purposes of determining the concentration check DC.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Over time, provoke at least 20 attacks of opportunity for casting conjuration (healing) spells on allies. These spells don’t have to succeed to count.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You automatically succeed at concentration checks for conjuration (healing) spells caused by taking damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="champion-story">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-champion-story"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Champion (Story)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#champion-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You must prove yourself through single combat.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have defeated a single challenging foe without any aid from another, or have the Champion of a God, Champion of the People, Competition Champion, or Gladiator background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can declare a single combat challenge to one foe within 50 feet and in line of sight. Upon doing so, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against that foe as long as no one else threatens that opponent or until the single combat challenge ends. If another combatant attacks you or your foe, the challenge ends and you take a —2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC for 1 round. Though you can declare a single combat challenge at will, once you declare it on a foe you can’t declare it on the same foe for another 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Defeat an appropriate number of challenging foes in single combat. These combats must not be interrupted by other creatures, and the foes must not have already been substantially injured or impaired prior to combat with you.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: Your bonuses for single combat increase to +2. In addition, any confirmed critical hits you make against such a foe deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="damned-story">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-damned-story"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Damned (Story)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#damned-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From your earliest days, you were destined to sacrifice everything in your quest for power.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have had friendly contact with an evil-aligned outsider that would qualify as a challenging foe, have a fiend-related sorcerous bloodline such as abyssal or infernal, have direct fiendish ancestry (such as being a tiefling or half-fiend), or have the Fiend Raised or The Fiend background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based checks involving evil-aligned outsiders and +1 bonus to the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against such creatures. You take a —2 penalty on Charisma-based checks involving good-aligned outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Successfully trade your soul to an evil outsider.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement bonus can’t be dispelled or removed save by the direct intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass spell resistance) against good-aligned outsiders. If you die while under the effects of this agreement, you can’t be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider permits it. You lose your completion benefits immediately and permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which you traded your soul, though you keep the feat’s basic benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deny-the-reaper-story">
<span id="ultimatecampaign-characterbackground-storyfeats-deny-the-reaper-story"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Deny the Reaper (Story)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#deny-the-reaper-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The lives you could not save stay with you to your final breath.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have witnessed the death of a close companion in battle—a death that could have been prevented, such as from bleeding, failure to stabilize, or ongoing poison damage—or have the Death in the Family or The War background.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong><strong>enefit</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.heal.html#corerulebook-skills-heal-heal"><span class="std std-ref">Heal</span></a> checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.heal.html#corerulebook-skills-heal-heal"><span class="std std-ref">Heal</span></a>, this bonus increases to +4. You can apply first aid as a move action and don’t take a penalty when treating deadly wounds without a healing kit.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Bring an ally back from the dead, including by using <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.breathoflife.html#corerulebook-spells-breathoflife-breath-of-life"><span class="std std-ref">breath of life</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.reincarnate.html#corerulebook-spells-reincarnate-reincarnate"><span class="std std-ref">reincarnate</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You and each ally within 10 feet of you gain a +2 bonus on saves against death effects. In addition, once per day you can spontaneously convert any 5th-level or higher conjuration (healing) spell into <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.breathoflife.html#corerulebook-spells-breathoflife-breath-of-life"><span class="std std-ref">breath of life</span></a>.</p>

<p>You seek new applications for magical energy.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have created a new spell, or have The Way Things Work background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When casting a spell you’ve created, add 1 to your caster level. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a> checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.spellcraft.html#corerulebook-skills-spellcraft-spellcraft"><span class="std std-ref">Spellcraft</span></a>, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Create a new spell of at least 6th level.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: The save DCs for any spells you create increase by 1 when you cast them. In addition, when applying metamagic feats to self-created spells, reduce the total level adjustment by 1. You can’t reduce metamagic costs to lower than the spell’s original level in this manner.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: For a self-created spell to benefit from this feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered from the original (for example, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.delayedblastfireball.html#corerulebook-spells-delayedblastfireball-delayed-blast-fireball"><span class="std std-ref">delayed blast fireball</span></a> as compared to <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.fireball.html#corerulebook-spells-fireball-fireball"><span class="std std-ref">fireball</span></a>) gain no benefit. Alchemists can benefit from this feat as though their formulae and extracts were spells.</p>

<p>You’re willing to lay down your life for your faith.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must be ordained as a sacred (or profane) champion of your faith by a high-ranking member of its clergy, or have the Devoted, Faith-Bringer, or Moral Debt background. Such an honor goes above and beyond the normal oaths required of a cleric or paladin.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, you can add a +2 bonus on any single attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check. You must choose to add this bonus after the die has been rolled and success or failure determined, but before any results (such as damage) are rolled and applied. If you have 10 or more levels or hit dice, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Die in pursuit of your faith’s goals and be brought back to life. If you die in circumstances that don’t involve your faith, you gain no benefit. If your GM permits, you can instead remain dead and create a new PC inspired by your heroic sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: If you died and came back, you become a living symbol of faith. Once per day as a standard action, you can inspire those who share your faith to great effort, granting them a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect. If you create a new character inspired by your previous character, the new PC receives a +2 bonus to a single ability score. This ability score can’t be one that already has a racial bonus. The new PC can later take this feat if he meets the prerequisite.</p>

<p>In your chest beasts the heart of a wild beast.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have reverted to savage behavior through a traumatic event or extended period in the wilderness, or have the Raised by Beasts background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you receive a morale bonus on Strength or attack rolls (such as from <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.heroism.html#corerulebook-spells-heroism-heroism"><span class="std std-ref">heroism</span></a> or the barbarian rage class feature), you receive a +2 bonus on Dexterity- and Strength-based ability and skill checks and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves until the morale bonus effect ends.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Woo and then marry or otherwise enter into a committed relationship with a person from a civilized culture. This relationship must be forged in love, not bought or coerced.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: Delay the penalties for the exhausted, fatigued, shaken, and sickened conditions for 1 round after first receiving them. If you already have the condition in question and it is applied again, this feat provides no benefit. Despite ignoring the penalties you do still have the condition. For example, if you become shaken again while benefiting from this feat, you become frightened as normal.</p>

<p>Your bitter feud with your enemies can be quenched only with blood.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have been defeated and robbed of at least half your possessions by a particular group of humanoids or monstrous humanoids, or have the An Eye for an Eye, Hated Foe, Raiders, or Vengeance background. You may choose a specific race, such as duergar, or a broader group, such as goblinoids. At the GM’s option, you may instead choose residents of a particular country, settlement, or tribe.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: The save DCs for your spells or abilities increase by 1 when you use them against the chosen group, and you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against their attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Slay an appropriate number of challenging foes.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You gain the benefits of the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#improved critical (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Improved Critical</span></a> feat on attacks made against members of your chosen race.

<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have suffered permanent memory loss or have the Reincarnated background.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: The duration of mind-affecting spells (even beneficial ones) is halved for you, to a minimum of 1 round. Your inquisitive nature gives you a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a>, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Regain a major portion of your lost memories. The exact means varies, possibly requiring a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.wish.html#corerulebook-spells-wish-wish"><span class="std std-ref">wish</span></a>, assistance from a divine being, reliving a past life, or confronting the situation that led to your memory loss. This process must involve encountering a challenging foe, though possibly in ways other than direct confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You roll twice whenever you attempt a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, keeping the better result.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Restoration of memories by means less significant than <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.miracle.html#corerulebook-spells-miracle-miracle"><span class="std std-ref">miracle</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.wish.html#corerulebook-spells-wish-wish"><span class="std std-ref">wish</span></a> does not qualify for the prerequisite.</p>

In addition, the effect of any ability damage, ability drain, or penalty to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is halved (minimum 1). You take a —2 penalty on Will saving throws. Whenever you roll a save against a mind-affecting effect, roll twice and keep the better result.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have at least one enemy who wishes to cause you great harm. If you have multiple enemies, the GM may keep the specific nemesis secret, or have many of your enemies work together against you. If your nemesis is not already a challenging foe, it either advances in strength to become a challenging foe or allies with others to achieve a higher challenge rating.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Having a nemesis drives you to excel in training. For each new level you gain in a favored class, including the level you gained when you chose this feat, you can choose two benefits instead of one. One of these benefits must be either a bonus hit point or a bonus skill point, even if other options are available.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: You can complete this goal in one of two fashions. First, thwart a chosen foe in a fashion that clearly establishes your superiority to the general public. Second, prove your worth another way, like gaining a title or becoming the chosen hero of a region.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can spend a move action to give battle orders to your troops, granting creatures under your command within 60 feet your choice of a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, or a +1 bonus on a single type of saving throw. All creatures must receive the same benefit. You can’t use this benefit on allies not under your command. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Build or capture a stronghold capable of housing a force of at least 200 troops, and staff it with at least 100 combat-capable soldiers (or the equivalent) under your command.

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Steal a famous and well-guarded treasure worth at least 50,000 gp while leaving no evidence of your involvement behind.
