<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-flung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
<p><strong>Unchained</strong>: Most of the summoner’s class features are the same as those of the class’s original design—the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon’s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>

<span id="unchained-classes-summoner-class-features"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Class Features</a><a class="headerlink" href="#class-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following are the class features of the summoner.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-spells"><strong>Spells</strong>: A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner’s spell list is different from that presented in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner’s Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p>
<p>A summoner’s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner’s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on the table below. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on the table below are fixed.)</p>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
<p>A summoner doesn’t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-cantrips"><strong>Cantrips</strong>: A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on the table below. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-eidolon"><strong>Eidolon</strong>: A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil.html#corerulebook-spells-protectionfromevil-protection-from-evil"><span class="std std-ref">protection from evil</span></a> and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon’s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic.html#corerulebook-spells-dispelmagic-dispel-magic"><span class="std std-ref">dispel magic</span></a>, but spells such as <em>dismissal</em> and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.banishment.html#corerulebook-spells-banishment-banishment"><span class="std std-ref">banishment</span></a> function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner’s desires. The eidolon’s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner’s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner’s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
<p>The eidolon’s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner’s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.alterself.html#corerulebook-spells-alterself-alter-self"><span class="std std-ref">alter self</span></a> or <em>polymorph</em> (although <em>invisibility</em> does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-life-link"><strong>Life Link (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-summon-monster"><strong>Summon Monster I (Sp)</strong>: At 1st level, a summoner can cast <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-i"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster I</span></a> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-ix"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster IX</span></a> at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as <em>gate</em> or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.summonmonster.html#corerulebook-spells-summonmonster-summon-monster-ix"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster IX</span></a>. If used as <em>gate</em>, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one <em>summon monster</em> or <em>gate</em> spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing <em>summon monster</em> or <em>gate</em> from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner’s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-bond-senses"><strong>Bond Senses (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-shield-ally"><strong>Shield Ally (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon’s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-makers-call"><strong>Maker’s Call (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.dimensiondoor.html#corerulebook-spells-dimensiondoor-dimension-door"><span class="std std-ref">dimension door</span></a>, using the summoner’s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-transposition"><strong>Transposition (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker’s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-aspect"><strong>Aspect (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon’s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon’s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon’s evolutions.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-greater-shield-ally"><strong>Greater Shield Ally (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner’s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-life-bond"><strong>Life Bond (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, the summoner’s life becomes linked to his eidolon’s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don’t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.balefulpolymorph.html#corerulebook-spells-balefulpolymorph-baleful-polymorph"><span class="std std-ref">baleful polymorph</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.fleshtostone.html#corerulebook-spells-fleshtostone-flesh-to-stone"><span class="std std-ref">flesh to stone</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.imprisonment.html#corerulebook-spells-imprisonment-imprisonment"><span class="std std-ref">imprisonment</span></a>, or other spells that don’t deal damage.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-merge-forms"><strong>Merge Forms (Su)</strong>: At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner’s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner’s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon’s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-greater-aspect"><strong>Greater Aspect (Su)</strong>: At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon’s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-twin-eidolon"><strong>Twin Eidolon (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon’s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

<p>An eidolon’s abilities are determined by the summoner’s level and by the choices made using its evolution pool. <a class="reference internal" href="#unchained-classes-summoner-eidolon-base-statistics"><span class="std std-ref">Table: Eidolon Base Statistics</span></a> determines many of the base statistics of the eidolon. Each eidolon possesses a base form that modifies these base statistics. Eidolons are outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.</p>
<p><strong>Class Level</strong>: This is the character’s summoner level.</p>
<p><strong>HD</strong>: This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the eidolon possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.</p>
<p><strong>BAB</strong>: This is the eidolon’s base attack bonus. An eidolon’s base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Good Saves and Poor Save</strong>: These are the eidolon’s base saving throw bonuses. An eidolon possesses two good saving throws and one poor saving throw, determined by the creature’s base form.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: This lists the eidolon’s total skill ranks. An eidolon can assign skill ranks to any skill, but it must possess the appropriate appendages to use some skills. Eidolons with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (an eidolon gains a number of skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die). An eidolon cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Eidolon skill ranks are set once chosen, even if the creature’s evolutions change when the summoner gains a new level.</p>
<p><strong>Feats</strong>: This is the total number of feats possessed by an eidolon. Eidolons can select any feat they qualify for, but they must possess the appropriate appendages to use some feats. Eidolon feats are set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the summoner gains a new level. If, due to such changes, the eidolon no longer qualifies for a feat, the feat has no effect until the eidolon once again qualifies for the feat.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Bonus</strong>: The number noted here is the eidolon’s base total armor bonus. This bonus can be split between an armor bonus and a natural armor bonus, as decided by the summoner. This number is modified by the eidolon’s base form and some options available through its evolution pool. An eidolon cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the summoner’s connection to the eidolon.</p>
<p><strong>Str/Dex Bonus</strong>: Add this modifier to the eidolon’s Strength and Dexterity scores, which are determined by its base form. Some options available through the eidolon’s evolution pool might modify these scores.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution Pool</strong>: The value given in this column is the total number of points in the eidolon’s evolution pool. Points in this pool can be spent on a wide variety of modifications and upgrades that add new abilities, attacks, and powers to the eidolon. Whenever the summoner gains a level, the number of points in this pool increases and the summoner can spend these points to change the abilities of the eidolon. These choices are not set—the summoner can change them whenever he gains a level (and through the <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.spells.transmogrify.html#advancedplayersguide-spells-transmogrify-transmogrify"><span class="std std-ref">transmogrify</span></a> spell).</p>
<p><strong>Max. Attacks</strong>: This indicates the maximum number of attacks that the eidolon is allowed to possess at the given level. If the eidolon is at its maximum, it cannot take evolutions that grant additional attacks. Attacks made with weapons, including those granted by a high base attack bonus, are counted against this maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: This includes a number of abilities gained by all eidolons as they increase in power (see the table below). Each of these bonuses is described below.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-darkvision"><strong>Darkvision (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-link"><strong>Link (Ex)</strong>: A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the summoner to give orders to his eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the summoner’s connection to his eidolon. As a result, the summoner and his eidolon share magic item slots. For example, if the summoner is wearing a ring, his eidolon can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the summoner remain active, and those used by the eidolon become dormant. The eidolon must possess the appropriate appendages to use a magic item.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-share-spells"><strong>Share Spells (Ex)</strong>: The summoner can cast a spell with a target of “you” on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A summoner can cast spells on his eidolon even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell list. This ability does not allow the eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-evasion"><strong>Evasion (Ex)</strong>: If the eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-ability-score-increase"><strong>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon adds 1 to one of its ability scores.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-devotion"><strong>Devotion (Ex)</strong>: An eidolon gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-multiattack"><strong>Multiattack</strong>: An eidolon gains <a class="reference internal" href="bestiary.monsterfeats.html#multiattack (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Multiattack</span></a> as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks (or it is reduced to fewer than three attacks), the eidolon instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty. If the eidolon later gains three or more natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead gains <a class="reference internal" href="bestiary.monsterfeats.html#multiattack (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Multiattack</span></a>.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-improved-evasion"><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex)</strong>: When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw and only half damage if it fails.</p>

<p>Generally, the summoner controls the actions of his eidolon, even during combat, either through verbal commands or through the link ability, but this does not mean that the eidolon is a puppet that follows every command without question. Eidolons have been known to refuse actions that are against their ethoses or alignments (subject to the GM’s discretion) and are quick to chide the summoner about such requests. In addition, should the action of the summoner cause a shift in alignment such that the summoner’s alignment is more than one step away from the eidolon’s, the eidolon refuses the call of the summoner (although the summoner can still use his <a class="reference internal" href="#unchained-classes-summoner-summon-monster"><span class="std std-ref">summon monster</span></a> class feature). If the summoner manages to restore his alignment, the eidolon returns to his service.</p>

<p>The first time a summoner calls his eidolon, he must decide on its subtype. The eidolon’s subtype determines a number of its base statistics and abilities, as well as its overall look and theme. The subtype also determines what sort of evolutions the summoner can select for his eidolon using the evolution pool. Once the choice of subtype is made, it cannot be changed.
As a summoner gains levels, his eidolon gains specific evolutions based on its subtype. Each subtype entry below includes the following information.
<strong>Name</strong>: This is the name of the eidolon’s subtype. The eidolon gains this as a subtype, but unless otherwise noted, it does not gain any of the features, abilities, or weaknesses of that subtype.
<strong>Description</strong>: This gives a basic overview of eidolons of this subtype, including general guidelines on appearance and personality.
<strong>Alignment</strong>: The eidolon is a creature of this alignment. If its alignment is chaotic, evil, lawful, or good, it gains that subtype.
<strong>Base Form</strong>: Eidolons of some subtypes are restricted in their choice of base form. Restrictions are spelled out here. The evolutions listed here are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon’s <span class="xref std std-ref">evolution pool</span>.
<strong>Base Evolutions</strong>: This describes the base evolutions possessed by all eidolons of this subtype. Following the entry is a list of evolutions gained as the summoner gains levels; these evolutions are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon’s evolution pool. In some cases, eidolons of certain subtypes will gain abilities that are not evolutions. Unless otherwise noted, such abilities function as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="bestiary.universalmonsterrules.html#bestiary-universalmonsterrules"><span class="std std-ref">Universal Monster Rules</span></a>.</p>

They often take graceful forms reminiscent of elves or fey, but they occasionally appear like lillends, with serpentine tails. Azata eidolons are flighty and independent, and they often have their own ideas about how to defeat evil or have a good time. Thus, an azata eidolon is likely to balk if its summoner commands it to perform offensive or nefarious actions. On the other hand, an azata eidolon in sync with its summoner is a passionate and devoted companion.

<p>The agents of horrible deaths, daemon eidolons desire the utter annihilation of all things. Their forms vary wildly depending on which type of death they embody, and daemon eidolons sometimes represent a more obscure kind of death than the most famous daemons. Daemon eidolons wish to sow death and misery through a variety of means. Most are capable of seeing the big picture, and will obediently follow even a neutral summoner. Ending lives is a typical part of an adventurer’s career, so following along with a summoner gives a daemon eidolon many opportunities to gather mortal soul energy for its own dark and inscrutable purposes.

Div eidolons particularly resent having mortal masters, and seek to doom their summoners to existences full of suffering and loss.

<p>Stewards, chroniclers, and guides of all things that die, psychopomps make dispassionate yet loyal eidolons. When they deal with the world of mortals, psychopomp eidolons nearly always wear masks. They do not tolerate summoners who traffic with daemons, undead, and other entities that interfere with the transmigration of souls, but otherwise they are comfortable with most actions on the summoner’s part. When the summoner dies, a psychopomp eidolon personally escorts him to the afterlife and serves as an expert witness when it is time for him to be judged.

<span id="unchained-classes-summoner-base-forms"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">Base Forms</a><a class="headerlink" href="#base-forms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each eidolon has one of three base forms that determines its starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All natural attacks are made using the eidolon’s full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted (such as in the case of secondary attacks). An eidolon’s attacks add the eidolon’s Strength modifier to the damage rolls, unless the eidolon has only one attack, in which case the attack adds 1-1/2 times the eidolon’s Strength modifier.
Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a Small eidolon. If the eidolon is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity. It takes a –4 penalty to Strength and a –2 penalty to Constitution. It also has a +1 size bonus to AC and on attack rolls, a –1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a +2 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.fly.html#corerulebook-skills-fly-fly"><span class="std std-ref">Fly</span></a> checks, and a +4 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.stealth.html#corerulebook-skills-stealth-stealth"><span class="std std-ref">Stealth</span></a> checks. Reduce the damage of all of its attacks by one step (for example, 1d6 becomes 1d4, and 1d4 becomes 1d3). If this choice is made, the eidolon can be made Medium whenever the summoner can change the eidolon’s evolution pool (which causes it to lose these modifiers for being Small). Likewise, a Medium eidolon can be made Small whenever the summoner can change the eidolon’s evolution pool.</p>

<p>Each eidolon gains a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the eidolon’s full base attack bonus and add the eidolon’s Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the eidolon’s base attack bonus – 5 and add 1/2 the eidolon’s Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the eidolon has only a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus, and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack’s type.
Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever the summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can be selected only once.</p>
<div class="section" id="point-evolutions">
<span id="unchained-classes-summoner-1-point-evolutions"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id33">1-Point Evolutions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#point-evolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following evolutions cost 1 point from the eidolon’s evolution pool.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-bite"><strong>Bite (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon’s maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite attack. This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If the eidolon already has a bite attack, this evolution allows it to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with its bite. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-claws"><strong>Claws (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon has a pair of vicious claws at the ends of its limbs, giving it two claw attacks. These attacks are primary attacks. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs evolution to take this evolution. This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of limbs evolutions the eidolon possesses. This evolution can be applied to any number of limbs (arms) evolutions, but no more than one limbs (legs) evolution. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-climb"><strong>Climb (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon becomes a skilled climber, gaining a climb speed equal to its base speed. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each additional time it is selected, increase the eidolon’s climb speed by 20 feet.</p>

<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-improved-damage"><strong>Improved Damage (Ex)</strong>: One of the eidolon’s natural attacks is particularly deadly. Select one natural attack form and increase the damage die by one step. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time the eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-improved-natural-armor"><strong>Improved Natural Armor (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon’s hide grows thick fur, rigid scales, or bony plates, giving it a +2 bonus to its natural armor. This evolution can be taken once, plus one additional time for every 5 levels the summoner possesses. Each additional time it’s taken, the bonus increases by 2.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-magic-attacks"><strong>Magic Attacks (Su)</strong>: The eidolon is infused with magic, allowing it to treat all of its natural attacks as if they were magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If the summoner is 10th level or higher, all of the eidolon’s natural attacks are treated as the alignment of the eidolon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-mount"><strong>Mount (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon is properly skilled and formed to serve as a combat-trained mount. The eidolon must be at least one size category larger than its rider. <em>Requirements</em>: Daemon, demon, devil, elemental, or protean subtype; quadruped or serpentine base form.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-pincers"><strong>Pincers (Ex)</strong>: An eidolon grows large pincers at the ends of one pair of its limbs, giving it two pincer attacks. These attacks are secondary attacks. The pincers deal 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). Eidolons with the grab evolution linked to their pincers gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. The eidolon must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws from its base form with pincers (this still costs 1 evolution point). This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of limbs (arms) evolutions the eidolon possesses. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-pull"><strong>Pull (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains the ability to pull creatures closer with a successful attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pulls the target of the attack 5 feet closer to it. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack. <em>Requirements</em>: Reach of 10 feet or more.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-push"><strong>Push (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains the ability to push creatures away with a successful attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pushes the target of the attack 5 feet directly away from it. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pushed in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-reach"><strong>Reach (Ex)</strong>: One of the eidolon’s attacks is capable of striking foes at a distance. Select one attack. The eidolon’s reach with that attack increases by 5 feet.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-resistance"><strong>Resistance (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon’s form takes on a resiliency to one particular energy type, which is usually reflected in its physical body (ashen hide for fire, icy breath for cold, and so on). Select one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The eidolon gains resistance 5 against that energy type. This resistance increases by 5 for every 5 levels the summoner possesses, to a maximum of 15 at 10th level. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time the eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different energy type.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-scent"><strong>Scent (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon’s sense of smell becomes quite acute. The eidolon gains the scent special quality, allowing it to detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if the opponent is downwind, the range drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the normal range. Scent does not allow the eidolon to precisely locate the creature, only to detect its presence. It can detect the direction as a move action. The eidolon can pinpoint the creature’s location if it is within 5 feet. The eidolon can use scent to track creatures.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-skilled"><strong>Skilled (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon becomes especially adept at a specific skill, gaining a +8 racial bonus on that skill. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time the eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different skill.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-slam"><strong>Slam (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon can deliver a devastating slam attack. This attack is a primary attack. The slam deals 1d8 points of damage (2d6 if Large, 2d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws from its base form with this slam attack (this still costs 1 evolution point). This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of the eidolon’s limbs (arms) evolutions.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-sting"><strong>Sting (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon possesses a long, barbed stinger at the end of its tail, granting it a sting attack. This attack is a primary attack.

This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of tail evolutions the eidolon possesses. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype; tail evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-swim"><strong>Swim (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains webbed hands, webbed feet, or powerful flippers, giving it a swim speed equal to its base speed. This evolution does not give the eidolon the ability to breathe underwater. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each additional time it is selected, increase the eidolon’s swim speed by 20 feet.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-tail"><strong>Tail (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows a long, powerful tail. This grants it a +2 racial bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.acrobatics.html#corerulebook-skills-acrobatics-acrobatics"><span class="std std-ref">Acrobatics</span></a> checks to balance on a surface. This evolution can be selected more than once. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype.</p>

<p>The following evolutions cost 2 points from the eidolon’s evolution pool.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-ability-increase"><strong>Ability Increase (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows larger muscles, gains faster reflexes, achieves greater intelligence, or acquires another increase to one of its abilities. Increase one of the eidolon’s ability scores by 2. This evolution can be selected more than once.

<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-constrict"><strong>Constrict (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains powerful muscles that allow it to crush those it grapples. Whenever the eidolon successfully grapples a foe using the grab evolution, it deals additional damage equal to the amount of damage dealt by the attack the grab evolution is tied to. <em>Requirements</em>: Serpentine base form, grab evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-energy-attacks"><strong>Energy Attacks (Su)</strong>: The eidolon’s attacks become charged with energy. Select one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. All of the eidolon’s natural attacks deal 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen type on a successful hit. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 5th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-flight"><strong>Flight (Ex or Su)</strong>: The eidolon grows large wings, like those of a bat, bird, insect, or dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. The eidolon’s maneuverability depends on its size. Medium or smaller eidolons have good maneuverability. Large eidolons have average maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor maneuverability. For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon flies by means of magic. It loses its wings, but its maneuverability increases to perfect. If the eidolon flies by magic, this is a supernatural ability. The eidolon can increase its fly speed by spending additional evolution points, gaining a 20-foot increase to its fly speed for each additional point spent. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 5th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-gore"><strong>Gore (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows a number of horns on its head, giving it a gore attack. This attack is a primary attack.

<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-immunity"><strong>Immunity (Su)</strong>: The eidolon’s body becomes extremely resilient to one energy type. Select one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The eidolon gains immunity to that energy type. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack.

<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-limbs"><strong>Limbs (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows an additional pair of limbs. These limbs can take one of two forms. They can be made into legs, complete with feet. Each pair of legs increases the eidolon’s base speed by 10 feet. Alternatively, they can be made into arms, complete with hands. The eidolon does not gain any additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but it can take other evolutions that add additional attacks (such as claws or slam). Arms that have hands can be used to wield weapons, if the eidolon is proficient. This evolution can be selected more than once.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-poison"><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon secretes toxic venom, gaining a poison attack. Select one bite or sting attack. Whenever the selected attack hits, the target is poisoned.
<em>Eidolon Poison</em>: Injury; <em>save</em> Fort negates; <em>frequency</em> 1/round for 4 rounds; <em>effect</em> 1d4 Str damage; <em>cure</em> 1 save.

This poison can be used no more than once per round. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 7th; daemon, demon, devil, elemental, or protean subtype; bite or sting evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-rake"><strong>Rake (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows dangerous claws on its feet, allowing it to make two rake attacks against foes it is grappling. These attacks are primary attacks. The eidolon can make these additional attacks each time it succeeds at a grapple check against the target. These rake attacks deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). This evolution counts as one natural attack toward the eidolon’s maximum. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 4th, quadruped base form.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-rend"><strong>Rend (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon learns to rip and tear the flesh of those it attacks with its claws, gaining the rend ability.

This damage is equal to the damage dealt by one claw attack plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon’s Strength modifier. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 6th, claws evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-trample"><strong>Trample (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains the ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a full-round action, the eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the eidolon does not need to attempt a check; it merely has to move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon’s Strength modifier. Targets of the trample can make attacks of opportunity at a –4 penalty. If a target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Strength modifier. A trampling eidolon can deal trampling damage to a specific creature only once per round. <em>Requirements</em>: Biped or quadruped base form.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-tremorsense"><strong>Tremorsense (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon becomes attuned to vibrations in the ground, gaining tremorsense with a range of 30 feet. This works like the blindsense evolution, but only if both the eidolon and the creature to be pinpointed are in contact with the ground. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 7th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-trip"><strong>Trip (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the ground with its bite, granting it a trip attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite attack, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, the target is knocked prone. If the eidolon fails, it is not tripped in return. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. <em>Requirements</em>: Daemon, demon, devil, elemental, or protean subtype; bite evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-weapon-training"><strong>Weapon Training (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon learns to use a weapon, gaining Simple Weapon Proficiency as a bonus feat. If 2 additional evolution points are spent, it gains proficiency with all martial weapons as well.</p>

<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-blindsense"><strong>Blindsense (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon’s senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense with a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it can’t see without having to attempt a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon. Visibility still affects the eidolon’s movement, and it is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-burrow"><strong>Burrow (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth. The eidolon gains a <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatemagic.spells.burrow.html#ultimatemagic-spells-burrow-burrow"><span class="std std-ref">burrow</span></a> speed equal to 1/2 its base speed. It can use this speed to move through clay, dirt, earth, and sand. It does not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-damage-reduction"><strong>Damage Reduction (Su)</strong>: The eidolon’s body becomes more resistant to harm. Increase the damage reduction granted by the eidolon’s subtype by 5. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 15th, damage reduction granted by the eidolon’s subtype.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-frightful-presence"><strong>Frightful Presence (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent that fails this save, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes with more Hit Dice than the eidolon are immune to this effect. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 11th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-pounce"><strong>Pounce (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains quick reflexes, allowing it to make a full attack after a charge. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 7th, quadruped base form.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-swallow-whole"><strong>Swallow Whole (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains the swallow whole ability, giving it the ability to consume its foes. If the eidolon begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it can attempt a combat maneuver check to swallow the creature. The creature must be at least one size category smaller than the eidolon. Swallowed creatures take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the eidolon’s bite damage each round + 1d6 points of damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light piercing or slashing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon’s total hit points. The eidolon’s AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the eidolon’s mouth, where it can attempt to escape or can be swallowed again. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th; agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype; grab (bite) evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-web"><strong>Web (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs. The eidolon can use these webs to support itself plus one creature of up to the same size. It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to eight times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with a successful <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.escapeartist.html#corerulebook-skills-escapeartist-escape-artist"><span class="std std-ref">Escape Artist</span></a> check, or with a Strength check at a –4 penalty. The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Constitution modifier. The webs have a hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon’s total Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its webs. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 7th; daemon, demon, or protean subtype; climb evolution.</p>

<span id="id4"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">4-Point Evolutions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#unchained-classes-summoner-4-point-evolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following evolutions cost 4 points from the eidolon’s evolution pool.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-blindsight"><strong>Blindsight (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon’s senses sharpen even further, granting it blindsight with a range of 30 feet. The eidolon can maneuver and attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility, and most forms of concealment as long as it has line of effect to the target. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 11th, blindsense evolution.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-breath-weapon"><strong>Breath Weapon (Su)</strong>: The eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per Hit Dice it possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Constitution modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The eidolon can gain additional uses of this ability per day by spending 1 evolution point per additional use (to a maximum of three total uses per day). <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-fast-healing"><strong>Fast Healing (Su)</strong>: The eidolon’s body gains the ability to heal wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals 1 point of damage per round, just like via  natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 point per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (to a maximum of 5 points per round). <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 11th.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-large"><strong>Large (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The eidolon gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a –1 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a –2 penalty on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.fly.html#corerulebook-skills-fly-fly"><span class="std std-ref">Fly</span></a> checks, and a –4 penalty on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.stealth.html#corerulebook-skills-stealth-stealth"><span class="std std-ref">Stealth</span></a> checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains a reach of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total.
If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead becomes Huge. The eidolon gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a –2 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a 10-foot reach, a –4 penalty on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.fly.html#corerulebook-skills-fly-fly"><span class="std std-ref">Fly</span></a> checks, and a –8 penalty on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.stealth.html#corerulebook-skills-stealth-stealth"><span class="std std-ref">Stealth</span></a> checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet instead of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from becoming Large.
The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution points) when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a Large or Huge eidolon. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 8th (13th for Huge), Medium size.</p>
<p id="unchained-classes-summoner-spell-resistance"><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon is protected against magic, gaining spell resistance. The eidolon’s spell resistance is equal to 11 + the summoner’s level. This spell resistance does not apply to spells cast by the summoner. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th.</p>
