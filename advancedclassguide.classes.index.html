<p>Most heroes progress along a single path—choosing to become a fearsome fighter, pious cleric, or mighty wizard—but some are drawn to many roads. For them, it can be hard to find a balance between abilities offered by disparate classes. Hybrid classes solve this dilemma by blending features from two classes, adding rules to make them work seamlessly together.</p>
<p><strong>Parent Classes</strong>: Each of the following classes draws upon two classes to form the basis of its theme. While a character can multiclass with these parent classes, doing so usually results in redundant abilities. Such abilities don’t stack unless specified. If a class feature allows the character to make a one-time choice (such as a bloodline), that choice must match similar choices made by the parent classes and vice-versa (such as selecting the same bloodline).</p>

<p>The ten new classes presented in this book are all hybrids of two existing classes from the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat</em>. The new classes are as follows.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="advancedclassguide.classes.arcanist.html#advancedclassguide-classes-arcanist"><span class="std std-ref">Arcanist</span></a>: Blending the power of the sorcerer with the versatility of the wizard, the arcanist draws upon a reservoir of power to bend magic to her will.</p>

<div class="section" id="racial-favored-class-options">
<span id="advancedclassguide-classes-index-racial-favored-class-options"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Racial Favored Class Options</a><a class="headerlink" href="#racial-favored-class-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The rules below allow members of races from the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em> to take alternate rewards when they gain a level in a favored class chosen from among the classes in this book. Racial favored class options were introduced in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, and expanded upon in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide</em>, which covers the base classes from the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Ultimate Combat</em>, and <em>Ultimate Magic</em>.</p>
<p>Each of these rewards replaces the normal reward for having a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank). Unlike those general rewards, these alternate favored class options speak directly to the features of specific classes and the general tendencies of various races.</p>
<p>Whenever you gain a level, you can choose which favored class option you take. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves.</p>
<p>Many of these alternate class rewards add only 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a roll (rather than 1) each time the reward is selected, or add 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a class ability (such as a bloodrager’s number of bloodrages per day or a swashbuckler’s total number of panache points). When applying such a benefit to a die roll or a class ability, always round down (minimum 0). You might thus need to select such an option several times before the benefit applies.</p>
<p>Some options have a fixed numerical limit, after which selecting such a favored class reward again has no effect. In these cases, you can always select from among the standard rewards when taking a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank).</p>
<div class="section" id="dwarves">
<span id="advancedclassguide-classes-index-dwarves"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Dwarves</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dwarves" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dwarves’ hardiness and stalwart resolve make them particularly well suited to the martial classes, but those who imagine them to be bereft of magic quickly learn the error of their ways. The following options are available to all dwarves who have the indicated favored class.</p>
<p><strong>Arcanist</strong>: Add 1/4 to the arcanist’s effective class level when determining the effects of the arcane barrier and arcane weapon arcanist exploits.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodrager</strong>: Increase the bloodrager’s total number of bloodrage rounds per day by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Brawler</strong>: Reduce the hardness of any object made from clay, stone, or metal by 1 (minimum 0) whenever the object is struck by the brawler’s unarmed strike.</p>

<p><strong>Investigator</strong>: Gain a +1/4 bonus on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> checks when underground and a +1/2 bonus to the investigator’s trap sense ability regarding stone traps.</p>

<p><strong>Swashbuckler</strong>: Add 1/4 to the swashbuckler’s effective class level to determine the extra damage she deals because of the precise strike deed when wielding a light pick or a heavy pick.
