<p><strong>School</strong> evocation; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> at least 10 minutes; see text</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (D) or until discharged</p>
<p>You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting <em>contingency</em>. The <em>contingency</em>spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast <em>contingency.</em></p>
<p>The spell to be brought into effect by the <em>contingency</em>must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p>
<p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <em>contingency</em>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<em>contingency</em>and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.</p>
<p>You can use only one <em>contingency</em>spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p>
