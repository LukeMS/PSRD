<p>This spell creates a vertical <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a>’s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall’s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a>, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).</p>
<p>A creature can move through a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check—failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> also radiates heat as if it were a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.walloffire.html#corerulebook-spells-walloffire-wall-of-fire"><span class="std std-ref">wall of fire</span></a>, although the heat from a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> radiates from both sides.</p>
<p>Once per round as a move action, you can direct the <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall’s overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.</p>
<p>All damage inflicted by physical contact with a <a class="reference internal" href="#advancedplayersguide-spells-walloflava-wall-of-lava"><span class="std std-ref">wall of lava</span></a> continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>
