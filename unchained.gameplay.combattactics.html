<p>While magic deals with complex formulae, precise manipulation of components, and intense concentration, martial acumen often relies on seizing opportunities and pushing the body and the will to carve a path to victory on the battlefield. Those who make their way in the world by skill at arms know that the determination to test the limits of endurance often separates the living from the dead and the vanquished from the victorious.</p>
<p>Stamina and combat tricks can help characters better reflect this opportunistic flexibility and the give-and-take of the battlefield. This system allows a character to draw upon an internal reservoir of will and gumption to overturn the assumed limitations of combat, at least for short bursts. With luck and proper timing, a martial character using this system can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat or put a despicable villain to a stunning end.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can implement this system in your game.</p>
<p><strong>Feat Access</strong>: The easiest way to introduce stamina and combat tricks into your game is to grant access to the Combat Stamina feat, detailed below. This allows those taking the feat to opt into the system, gain a stamina pool, and use stamina to increase the utility of combat feats and class features they already have or will gain in the future. In general, the Combat Stamina feat is quite strong for martial characters with a variety of combat feats.</p>
<p><strong>Free for Fighters</strong>: If your goal is to provide an additional edge to the fighter class, you can allow fighters to gain the Combat Stamina feat as an additional bonus feat at 1st level.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter Bonus Feats Only</strong>: If you want to significantly strengthen fighters compared to all other classes and keep this system as a special fighter-only perk, you can restrict the Combat Stamina feat to fighters and limit the feats a character can use with his stamina pool to those gained with the fighter’s bonus feats. A multiclass fighter can’t use stamina with bonus feats he gained from any other class, even if that class can take fighter-only feats as bonus feats (like the warpriest and the swashbuckler). In this version, if a character really wants the stamina ability of a few key feats, he will need to diversify his martial training by taking a level in fighter.</p>
<p><strong>Free for Everyone</strong>: If your goal is to immediately boost all martial characters and the whole group is ready to handle the stamina and combat tricks system, you can grant Combat Stamina as an additional bonus feat for all martial characters, or even for all characters.</p>
<div class="section" id="stamina-pool">
<span id="unchained-gameplay-combattactics-stamina-pool"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Stamina Pool</a><a class="headerlink" href="#stamina-pool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you have an ability that grants you stamina points, you gain a stamina pool with a maximum number of stamina points equal to your base attack bonus + your Constitution modifier. During combat, you can spend stamina points from this pool to perform a combat trick, the specific effects of which are dictated by a combat feat you possess. Spending stamina points in this way is not an action, but you can’t do so if you are unconscious, fatigued, or exhausted. You can use as many combat tricks on the same action or attack as you like (as long as you have the stamina points to spend), but you can’t use the same combat trick twice within its scope. For instance, if you have a combat trick that affects a single attack, you can’t use that combat trick more than once on the same attack.</p>
<p>Dropping to 0 stamina points causes you to become fatigued until you have 1 or more points in your stamina pool.</p>
<p>Temporary increases to your Constitution score, such as those granted by the core barbarian’s rage class feature or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.bearsendurance.html#bear's endurance"><span class="std std-ref">bear’s endurance</span></a>, do not increase the number of stamina points in your pool or your pool’s maximum number of stamina points. However, permanent increases to Constitution, such as the bonus granted by a <em>belt of mighty constitution</em> worn for more than 24 hours, do adjust your stamina points.</p>
<p>You regain stamina points by resting for short periods of time. You don’t have to sleep while resting in this way, but you can’t exert yourself. You stop regaining stamina points if you enter combat; take an action that requires a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Constitution-based skill check or an ability check tied to one of those ability scores; or take more than one move action or standard action in a round (you can still take free, immediate, and swift actions). This reduction in your number of actions per round also effectively halves your overland speed. For each uninterrupted minute you rest in this way, you regain 1 stamina point. If you are suffering from any of the following conditions, you can’t regain stamina points: confused, cowering, dazed, dead, disabled, exhausted, fascinated, frightened, helpless, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, petrified, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.</p>

<p>The following feats are used with the stamina and combat tricks system. The basic feat is Combat Stamina, which grants you a stamina pool and allows you to use the most basic combat trick for this system. The other feats give you options for expanding your stamina pool.</p>
<div class="section" id="combat-stamina-combat">
<span id="unchained-gameplay-combattactics-combat-stamina-combat"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Combat Stamina (Combat)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#combat-stamina-combat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You stop at nothing to drive your attack home.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +1.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a stamina pool. After you make an attack roll with a manufactured weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon attack with which you are proficient, but before the results are revealed, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. If you do, you gain a competence bonus on the attack roll equal to the number of stamina points you spent. If you miss with the attack, the stamina points you spent are still lost.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Since you have a stamina pool, you can spend your stamina points to use any combat tricks associated with combat feats you possess.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extra-stamina-combat">
<span id="unchained-gameplay-combattactics-extra-stamina-combat"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Extra Stamina (Combat)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#extra-stamina-combat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can push yourself to higher limits.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: <a class="reference internal" href="#combat stamina (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Combat Stamina</span></a>, base attack bonus +5.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your stamina pool increases by 3 points.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this feat up to three times. Each time you do, your stamina pool grows by 3 points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="push-the-limits-combat">
<span id="unchained-gameplay-combattactics-push-the-limits-combat"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Push the Limits (Combat)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#push-the-limits-combat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even when suffering from fatigue, you can fight through and overcome incredible opposition.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 13, <a class="reference internal" href="#combat stamina (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Combat Stamina</span></a>, base attack bonus +1.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a secondary stamina pool with a number of stamina points equal to your Constitution modifier. You can spend these secondary stamina points only when you have 0 stamina points in your primary stamina pool or when you are fatigued, even though you normally can’t spend stamina points while fatigued. You can spend these secondary stamina points as normal, but if the secondary pool drops to 0 points, you become exhausted until you have at least 1 stamina point in your primary pool. Even if you have points in your secondary pool, you are still fatigued as long as you have 0 points in your primary pool. Your secondary pool refreshes only after a full night’s rest.</p>

<span id="unchained-gameplay-combattactics-combat-tricks"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Combat Tricks</a><a class="headerlink" href="#combat-tricks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nearly every combat feat has a combat trick associated with it. Some very basic feats, such as weapon and proficiency feats, do not; nor do feats that expand upon the stamina and combat tricks system. The following combat tricks are for the combat feats found in the <em>PRD Core Rulebook</em>, <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Ultimate Magic</em>, <em>Ultimate Combat</em>, <em>Advanced Race Guide</em>, and <em>Advanced Class Guide</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Adder Strike (Combat)</strong>: You can spend 2 stamina points to apply poison to a manufactured weapon as a swift action.</p>
<p><strong>Agile Maneuvers (Combat)</strong>: You can spend a number of stamina points equal to your Dexterity bonus while attempting combat maneuver checks.

<p><strong>Amateur Gunslinger (Combat)</strong>: Choose a second 1st-level gunslinger deed. You can spend grit to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of grit. If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of grit when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#extra grit (grit)"><span class="std std-ref">Extra Grit</span></a> feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat).</p>
<p><strong>Amateur Swashbuckler (Combat)</strong>: Choose a second 1st-level swashbuckler deed. You can spend panache to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of panache. If you gain levels in a class that grants the panache class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of panache when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Panache feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat).</p>
<p><strong>Anticipate Dodge (Combat)</strong>: You can spend 1 stamina point to increase the maximum bonus from Anticipate Dodge by 2 (this is still limited by the creature’s dodge bonus, however).</p>

If you have the martial flexibility class feature, you can spend 5 stamina points to use that class feature as a swift action instead of a move action, or as a free action instead of a swift action.</p>
<p><strong>Bashing Finish (Combat)</strong>: When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a shield bash attack against the target anyway. You still can’t make the attack if the target is immune to critical hits.</p>

<p><strong>Befuddling Strike (Combat)</strong>: You can spend 5 stamina points to declare that you are using Befuddling Strike after you’ve hit with an unarmed strike attack roll.</p>

<p><strong>Bludgeoner (Combat)</strong>: When you make an attack with a lethal bludgeoning weapon to deal nonlethal damage, you can spend 2 stamina points to treat the weapon’s damage as if the weapon were one size category larger. This does not stack with any other effects that treat the weapon’s damage as if the weapon were a larger size.</p>

<p><strong>Boar Style (Combat, Style)</strong>: While using this style, you can spend 3 stamina points when you hit a target with only one unarmed strike during a round to tear flesh and deal 2d6 points of damage with the attack. You can still only tear flesh once per round.</p>

<p><strong>Bodyguard (Combat)</strong>: When you use an attack of opportunity to use an aid another action to improve an adjacent ally’s Armor Class, you can spend 1 or 2 stamina points. Increase the bonus to the ally’s AC by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.</p>

<p><strong>Bull Rush Strike (Combat)</strong>: When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to bull rush the target anyway. If you do, reroll the confirmation roll to determine if the bull rush attempt exceeds the opponent’s CMD. This reroll is only for the bull rush combat maneuver; it can’t cause the critical hit to be confirmed. You still can’t make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying Blow (Combat)</strong>: You can spend 2 stamina points to gain the effects of this feat on a single attack made as part of a full attack.</p>
<p><strong>Canny Tumble (Combat)</strong>: Just before you make an attack roll with the +2 circumstance bonus granted by this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. When you do, if your attack hits, you gain a bonus on the damage roll equal to double the number of stamina points spent.</p>

<p><strong>Combat Patrol (Combat)</strong>: When moving before or after making an attack of opportunity while using <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats.html#combat patrol (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Combat Patrol</span></a>, you can spend 1 stamina point per 5 feet moved. When you do, that movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Reflexes (Combat)</strong>: When you miss with an attack of opportunity, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a second attack for the same provoking action. That second attack of opportunity takes a –5 penalty on the attack roll and costs one of your attacks of opportunity for the round.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style Master (Combat)</strong>: When it is not your turn, you can spend 2 stamina points to take the free action to switch your style.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Charge (Combat, Teamwork)</strong>: When an ally with this feat charges a creature, and that creature is farther than your speed but no farther than double your speed, you can spend 5 stamina points to charge that creature.

If you continue to roll 19 or 20, you can continue to spend stamina points for additional rolls, and the increases to the critical multiplier stack.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Mastery (Combat)</strong>: When you confirm a critical hit, instead of applying the effects of two critical feats you possess, you can spend 2 stamina points to apply the effect of any one critical feat you don’t possess (but for which you qualify).</p>
<p><strong>Critical Versatility (Combat)</strong>: You can spend 5 stamina points to use this feat a second time per day.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow Mastery (Combat)</strong>: As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, reloading any kind of crossbow no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Crusader’s Fist (Combat)</strong>: When you use <a class="reference internal" href="ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats.html#crusader's fist (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Crusader’s Fist</span></a> and confirm a critical hit, you can spend 5 stamina points to multiply the extra damage for that critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>Crushing Blow (Combat)</strong>: When using this feat, you can spend either 2 or 4 stamina points.

<p><strong>Dastardly Finish (Combat)</strong>: You can spend 10 stamina points to deliver a coup de grace against two helpless, cowering, or stunned targets within your reach as a full-round action. This provokes attacks of opportunity twice—one for each coup de grace.</p>

<p><strong>Dazzling Display (Combat)</strong>: When wielding a melee weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you can make a single melee attack as a standard action against a foe. If the attack hits, you can select any number of foes within 30 feet who saw the attack, including that foe. Spend 2 stamina points per foe you have selected, then attempt an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.intimidate.html#corerulebook-skills-intimidate-intimidate"><span class="std std-ref">Intimidate</span></a> check to demoralize those foes.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Aim (Combat)</strong>: When using this feat, you can spend 4 stamina points to reduce the penalty to attack rolls imposed by the feat by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. You can’t reduce the penalty below 0.</p>
