Wondrous Items
***************

Wondrous items is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups of magic items. Any creature can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description, such as requiring a particular class feature).

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.wondrousitems#all_tools_vest`:

All Tools Vest
===============

\ **Aura**\  faint conjuration; \ **CL**\  1st

\ **Slot**\  chest; \ **Price**\  1,800 gp; \ **Weight**\  5 lbs.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.magicitems.wondrousitems#description`:

Description
============

The stitching along the many pockets of this light leather vest depicts cheerful laborers going about their daily work. Once per day, as a standard action, the wearer can speak its command word and order it to bring forth all the standard tools required to make checks for any one :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  skill. These tools appear in the countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another creature touches them, whichever comes first.

\ **Aura**\  moderate universal; \ **CL**\  9th

\ **Slot**\  neck; \ **Price**\  20,000 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

Description
============

Each silver link that makes up this heavy necklace represents a well-known concept of arcane theory. A universalist wizard who selects the necklace as his bonded object (which counts as an amulet) may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chose "evocation" when he prepared his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\  into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.

Construction
=============

\ **Requirements**\  :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ , :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\ , creator must be a universalist; \ **Cost**\  10,000 gp

Description
============

Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes seem, ever so briefly, to flicker in and out of existence. A transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously cast :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\  in place of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.

Construction

\ **Slot**\  hands; \ **Price**\  180 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

Description
============

The wearer of this simple glove can speak a command word to transform it into a glowing disembodied hand. As a swift action, the wearer can have the glove assist him with a task as if using the aid another action; the glove uses the wearer's base attack bonus or skill ranks when making the check to see if aid another is successful (it does not gain the benefit of the wearer's ability scores or other bonuses).

\ **Slot**\  chest; \ **Price**\  200 gp; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.

Description
============

These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any creature wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability damage each day as if receiving complete bed rest regardless of activity (\ *PRD Core Rulebook*\ 191). A creature actually receiving long-term care (from the :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  skill) or complete bed rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each day.

Description
============

Each pair of these supple leather boots corresponds to a specific sort of environment as defined by the ranger's favored terrain class feature (jungle, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the boots can treat the corresponding environment of the boots as one of his favored terrains, granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has that particular environment as one of his favored terrains, his bonus for that terrain increases by +2.

============

This green glass bottle has a tiny winding key on its elongated stem that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become substantial over a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the bottle speaks into the bottle during this time (up to 25 words) gets trapped inside it once the cork fully manifests. As soon as the cork is removed or the bottle is smashed, this message is released exactly as if the owner had spoken the words at that moment. Once the bottle releases its message, it shatters.

Description

Description
============

This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. The wearer can, as a swift action, order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer a concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field ends, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.

Description
============

This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the wearer's entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his face and drop to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the :ref:`sanctuary <corerulebook.spells.sanctuary#sanctuary>`\  spell). The wearer cannot see or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless.

This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by \ *defoliant polish*\  with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful attack.

While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, 8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC.
