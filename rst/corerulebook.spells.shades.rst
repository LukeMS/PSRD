Shades
=======

\ **School**\  illusion (shadow); \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions like :ref:`shadow conjuration <corerulebook.spells.shadowconjuration#shadow_conjuration>`\ , except that it mimics conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths (80%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80% likely to work against nonbelievers.
