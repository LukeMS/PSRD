Erase Impressions
==================

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  medium 3, mesmerist 4, occultist 3, psychic 5, spiritualist 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 round

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  object touched

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (object); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (object)

You banish psychic impressions from the object touched, rendering it devoid of recent history. You choose how much time to erase, up to a maximum of 1 day per caster level. You must erase impressions from the present time back; you cannot choose to leave recent events untouched. Impressions erased in this manner cannot be recovered via :ref:`object reading <occultadventures.spells.objectreading#object_reading>`\ , :ref:`legend lore <corerulebook.spells.legendlore>`\ , or similar measures.

Casting \ *erase impressions*\  on a corpse removes recent psychic impressions from when the creature was alive as well, making those memories unavailable to :ref:`speak with dead <corerulebook.spells.speakwithdead#speak_with_dead>`\ . For example, a 5th-level caster casting the spell on a 2-day-old corpse could erase the past 2 days of psychic impressions from the corpse and 3 additional days of information from just before the creature died.
