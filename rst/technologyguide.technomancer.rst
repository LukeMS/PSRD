Class Skills
*************

The technomancer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

\ **Skill Ranks per Level**\ : 4 + Int modifier.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#class_features`:

Class Features
***************

The following are all class features of the technomancer.

\ **Weapon and Armor Proficiency**\ : A technomancer gains proficiency with all firearms.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#recondition`:

\ **Recondition (Su):**\  Through constant maintenance, a technomancer can keep a single piece of still-functioning timeworn technology in good working order. Reconditioning a timeworn technological item takes 8 hours, after which the item no longer has a chance of glitching when used by the technomancer and can be recharged normally by the technomancer but no one else. Keeping the item working requires 1 hour of maintenance each day (this can overlap with the time needed to prepare spells), or the item reverts to a normal piece of timeworn technology and must be reconditioned again. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a technomancer can keep an additional item in good working order, without increasing his daily maintenance time.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#technical_expertise`:

\ **Technical Expertise (Ex)**\ : A technomancer adds his class level to Craft, Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), and Linguistics checks regarding technology.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#efficient_construction`:

\ **Efficient Construction (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a technomancer using a technological crafting lab reduces the necessary energy expenditure of the facility by 25%. At 10th level, this energy reduction increases to 50%.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#technic_spell_mastery`:

\ **Technic Spell Mastery (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a technomancer selects one of the following spells: :ref:`antitech field <technologyguide.spells#antitech_field>`\ , :ref:`destroy robot <technologyguide.spells#destroy_robot>`\ , :ref:`detect radiation <technologyguide.spells#detect_radiation>`\ , :ref:`discharge <technologyguide.spells#discharge>`\ , \ *greater*\  \ *discharge*\ , \ *greater*\  \ *remove radioactivity*\ , :ref:`infuse robot <technologyguide.spells#infuse_robot>`\ , :ref:`irradiate <technologyguide.spells#irradiate>`\ , :ref:`magic circle against technology <technologyguide.spells#magic_circle_against_technology>`\ , :ref:`memory of function <technologyguide.spells#memory_of_function>`\ , :ref:`rebuke technology <technologyguide.spells#rebuke_technology>`\ , :ref:`recharge <technologyguide.spells#recharge>`\ , :ref:`remove radioactivity <technologyguide.spells#remove_radioactivity>`\ , :ref:`protection from technology <technologyguide.spells#protection_from_technology>`\ , or :ref:`technomancy <technologyguide.spells#technomancy>`\ . (Additional technology-related spells can be added to this list at the GM's discretion.) If the spell chosen isn't one that's normally on his class spell list, he adds it to his class spell list at the level a wizard casts the spell. The spell chosen must be of a spell level he would otherwise be able to cast. If he prepares spells, he can prepare this spell one additional time in excess of the normal maximum number of spells he can prepare. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds the spell to his spells known, and can cast this spell once per day without using a daily spell slot.

At 5th level, he picks another spell from the list above, and at 8th level, he picks a 3rd spell from the list above.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#arcane_battery`:

\ **Arcane Battery (Su)**\ : At 3rd level as a swift action, a technomancer can expend an unused spell slot (if he's a spontaneous caster) or a prepared spell (if he prepares spells) to power a technological device he touches. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren't provided by the technomancer must come from the device's own power reserves. He can use this ability to power timeworn technology. He can't power devices that don't use charges.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#study_technology`:

\ **Study Technology (Ex)**\ : At 3rd level, a technomancer can study a robot, technological object, or technological trap within 30 feet as a move action and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to identify it. If he succeeds, he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his level on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill checks involving the studied creature, object, or trap, as well as a dodge bonus of the same amount against attacks from the subject of his study. This bonus lasts a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If he studies a new subject, he loses his bonus against the previous subject.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#recycle_technology`:

\ **Recycle Technology (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, a technomancer can dismantle existing technological items and construct new ones from the parts, though such creations are prone to malfunctioning. He trades in each item for an amount of crafting potential based on a fraction of its crafting cost (not price), as described below. He can use this potential and his technological crafting feats to make a new item. For example, a technomancer could use a broken laser pistol in place of 500 gp for crafting technological items (10% of the laser pistol's crafting cost of 5,000 gp). He then follows the normal rules for crafting a technological item (see page 16), except that he must pay at least 50% of the crafting cost using recycled technology. If he pays 100% of the cost in this fashion, he crafts the item at double the normal speed. In the process of cannibalizing the old items, the new items are destroyed and any excess gold value is lost. The item he creates is considered timeworn technology, even if new items were broken down to build it. Recycle technology cannot be used to build constructs, cybertech, pharmaceuticals, or technology that uses nanites.

   * - Broken or nonfunctional
     - 10% of crating cost

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#command_robot`:

\ **Command Robot (Sp)**\ : At 5th level, a technomancer can issue a command to a robot within 30 feet as a standard action once per day. The command must be in a language the robot can understand. The robot can resist the effects of this ability by succeeding at a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the technomancer's class level + the technomancer's Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). At 7th level, a technomancer can use this ability twice per day, and at 9th level he can use it three times per day. This ability otherwise functions as :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\ , save that it is not mind-affecting and can only affect constructs with the robot subtype.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#unified_energy`:

\ **Unified Energy (Su)**\ : At 6th level, a technomancer can draw power from a technological device in his possession to cast a spell he knows (if a spontaneous caster) or a spell he currently has prepared (if he prepares spells) without expending a spell slot or prepared spell. He consumes 2 charges from the device for each spell level of the spell being cast. In the process of casting the spell, he can apply any of his metamagic feats, using a number of charges appropriate to the increase in spell level, but he cannot exceed the highest effective level of spell he is able to cast. He can use this ability multiple times per day, but never in excess of a number of charges equal to twice his technomancer level (so at 6th level, he can consume no more than 12 charges per day using this ability).

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#applied_learning`:

\ **Applied Learning (Ex)**\ : At 8th level, when a technomancer succeeds at a saving throw against a technological effect that has reduced effects on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless or flat-footed technomancer does not benefit from this ability.

.. _`technologyguide.technomancer#field_improvisation`:

\ **Field Improvisation (Ex)**\ : At 10th level, a technomancer can recycle technology with astounding speed. Each hour of crafting when using his recycle technology ability is equivalent to 8 hours of uninterrupted crafting; he can perform up to 8 hours of such amazingly efficient work per day. Any item he completes is treated as reconditioned for the remainder of that day. It can be added permanently to his group of reconditioned items if he has an available slot or stops maintaining one of his current reconditioned items.
