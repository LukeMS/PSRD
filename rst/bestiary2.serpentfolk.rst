Special Abilities
==================
:ref:`Poison <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#poison_(ex_or_su)>`\  (Ex) Bite—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 15; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d2 Str; \ *cure*\  2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
To the serpentfolk, the pursuit of knowledge and magic is the highest goal. Their legends speak of how humanity rose to power only through the theft of serpent magic, a legend that may form the basis of the hatred toward humanity most serpentfolk harbor. They view themselves as the undisputed masters of magic, be it arcane or divine. Yet despite this, the majority of serpentfolk today are degenerates who have devolved to the point of primeval savagery and have lost much of their magical legacy—more civilized serpentfolk generally regard these degenerates with shame and disdain.
Serpentfolk are 6 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds. Degenerates are only 5 feet tall but weigh 200 pounds. All serpentfolk are quite long-lived, and generally live to the age of 500.
Advanced Serpentfolk
When a serpentfolk gains class levels, several of its abilities increase as well, as detailed below.

*   Spell Resistance equals total Hit Dice + 10.

*   Poison bite save DC equals 10 + Con modifier + 1/2 total Hit Dice.

*   When it is 4th level in any class combination, it gains two spell-like abilities usable once per day each: :ref:`dominate person <corerulebook.spells.dominateperson#dominate_person>`\  and :ref:`major image <corerulebook.spells.majorimage#major_image>`\ . When it reaches 9th level in any combination, it gains two more usable once per day each: :ref:`mass suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion_mass>`\  and :ref:`teleport <corerulebook.spells.teleport#teleport>`\ .

*   A serpentfolk's racial ability score modifiers are as follows: Str –2, Dex +10, Con +6, Int +8, Wis +4, Cha +6.

Degenerate Serpentfolk
Degenerate serpentfolk possess the same statistics as normal serpentfolk, save for the following adjustments.

*   They have no spell-like abilities.

*   They lose the +4 racial bonus on :ref:`Use Magic Device <corerulebook.skills.usemagicdevice#use_magic_device>`\  checks, but gain a +4 racial bonus on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks.

*   Their natural armor bonus increases from +3 to +7.

*   They have the following ability score modifiers: Str +10, Dex +2, Con +8, Int –6 (minimum 3), Wis +2, Cha –4. A typical degenerate serpentfolk's ability scores are Str 20, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 6.
