Special Abilities
==================

\ **Find Target (Su)**\  Once per day, an iron cobra's creator can order it to find and kill a specific creature within 1 mile, which it does as if guided by :ref:`discern location <corerulebook.spells.discernlocation#discern_location>`\ . The creator must have seen or be holding an item from the specified creature for this order to function.

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  An iron cobra's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its body. Because it is a construct, the cobra does not naturally produce this poison, and its creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds enough poison for 3 successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically black adder venom), though acid, alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used.\ *Black Adder Venom*\ : Bite—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 11; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d2 Con :ref:`damage <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#ability_damage_and_drain>`\ ; \ *cure*\  1 save.

The iron cobra is a simple construct that resembles a hooded cobra made out of metal. The iron cobra is typically used as a bodyguard or guardian of treasure, though its magical ability to unerringly locate creatures means it is also used as an assassin. Since an iron cobra's poison reservoir can contain multiple types of venom, the construct's specific use can be further tailored by varying the poison used. Some spellcasters even fill these reservoirs with potions, so that when the cobra bites, it injects the potion into its target. This is a somewhat dangerous method for gaining the effects of a potion, but it does free up the cobra's master to do other things in a combat round apart from quaffing potions.

Iron is the most common material for these creations, but some crafters prefer more exotic materials when creating the serpentine constructs.
