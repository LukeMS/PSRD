Weakness Racial Traits
***********************

The following racial traits apply weaknesses to members of the race. All weakness racial traits cost negative RP, which means they subtract from a race's total RP spent for the purposes of meeting the race's power level restrictions. 

Standard Traits

\ **Light Blindness (–2 RP)**\ : \ *Prerequisite*\ : Darkvision or see in darkness trait; \ *Weakness*\ : Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds members of this race for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.

Quadrupeds and Magic Item Slots
********************************

Creating a race with more than two legs adversely affects that race's ability to use standard feet slot magic items. The best way to deal with this is to create variant magic item versions of the various boots, shoes, and slippers that can be worn by this race. Allow members of these races to find ankle bracelets of :ref:`speed <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_speed>`\  or horseshoes of :ref:`spider climb <corerulebook.spells.spiderclimb#spider_climb>`\  that act just like their traditional magic item counterparts, but fit the new race's form.
