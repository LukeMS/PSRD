Step 3: Subtype Graft
######################

Find the monster's subtype (if any) in the list below and apply all abilities listed there. For monsters that replicate common PC races (such as humans or elves), the subtype includes the equivalent of their important racial traits as well. These entries don't always include all the abilities a creature gains from the subtypes as they appear in Bestiary volumes; they omit rules that are only relevant for creating the creature, those that cover the monster's noncombat abilities (such as whether it eats or sleeps), and abilities that aren't as useful for NPCs as they would be for PCs (such as a dwarf's stonecunning ability).

Subtype graft entries use a short format. After the name, each subtype entry has one to three sections listing its abilities, separated by category. Some grafts grant a monster additional senses, movement types, bonuses, or other statistic adjustments. Abilities listed under the options and skills sections are found on Step 7 and 8, respectively. Finally, some abilities directly refer to a universal monster rule in a Bestiary.

All subtype abilities are added automatically; none are optional. They're meant to be included in addition to all the skills and options you can choose for the monster based on its CR and array. Likewise, subtype entries might tell you to add particular monster options or skills. These don't count against the monster's normal number of options or skills.

Other Subtypes
***************

A number of subtypes don't have full entries. Most of these don't grant additional abilities to monsters, and are listed below. A monster gains all subtypes appropriate to it, even those without rules in this chapter, such as the following.

Complex Subtypes
*****************

The subtypes listed below don't appear because they're so complex that adding a subtype graft isn't enough. Creatures of these subtypes need to be created carefully, and have detailed rules associated with them that go beyond the scope of simple monster creation.

* :ref:`Behemoth <bestiary.creaturetypes#behemoth_subtype>`

* :ref:`Colossus <bestiary.creaturetypes#colossus_subtype>`

* :ref:`Great Old One <bestiary.creaturetypes#great_old_one_subtype>`

* :ref:`Kaiju <bestiary.creaturetypes#kaiju_subtype>`

* :ref:`Mythic <bestiary.creaturetypes#mythic_subtype>`
