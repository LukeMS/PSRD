Half-dragons are only rarely the result of dragons mating with other creatures—most are the result of strange magical experiments. In most cases, a successful creation breeds true with others of its kind, as with the dreaded dracolisk.

Creating a Half-Dragon
***********************

"Half-dragon" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-dragon retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

\ **CR**\ : Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum 3).

\ **Type**\ : Creature type changes to :ref:`dragon <bestiary.creaturetypes#dragon>`\ . Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

\ **Armor Class**\ : Nat. armor improves by +4.

\ **Special Qualities and Defenses**\ : A half-dragon gains darkvision 60 feet; low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, paralysis, and energy of the same type as its breath weapon.

\ **Speed**\ : A half-dragon has wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the half-dragon can fly at twice the creature's base land speed (average maneuverability).

\ **Melee**\ : A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack. If the base creature can use manufactured weapons, the half-dragon can as well. A new claw or bite attack deals damage as appropriate for the half-dragon's size  (see :ref:`Natural Attacks <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#natural_attacks>`\ .)

\ **Special Abilities**\ : A half-dragon retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains a breath weapon usable once per day based on the dragon variety (see below). The breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per racial HD possessed by the half-dragon (Reflex half; DC 10 + 1/2 creature's racial HD + creature's Con modifier).
