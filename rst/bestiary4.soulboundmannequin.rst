Special Abilities
==================

\ **Alignment Variation (Ex)**\  Soulbound mannequins are at least partially neutral in alignment, although they can also be chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. They have an alignment-dependent spell-like ability usable once per day as listed below.

* \ *Chaotic Neutral:*\  :ref:`confusion <corerulebook.spells.confusion#confusion>`\  (DC 13)

* \ *Lawful Neutral*\ : :ref:`fear <corerulebook.spells.fear#fear>`\  (DC 13)

* \ *Neutral*\ : :ref:`hold monster <corerulebook.spells.holdmonster#hold_monster>`\  (DC 13)

* \ *Neutral Evil*\ : :ref:`enervation <corerulebook.spells.enervation#enervation>`

* \ *Neutral Good*\ : :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`

.. _`bestiary4.soulboundmannequin#disguise_self`:

:ref:`Disguise <corerulebook.skills.disguise#disguise>`\  Self (Sp) The soulbound mannequin can only disguise itself as the living person it used to be at approximately the age it was when its soul was used to make the mannequin (this allows it to take the appearance of another creature type).

.. _`bestiary4.soulboundmannequin#soul_focus`:

\ **Soul Focus (Su)**\  The soul bound to the mannequin lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically a carved mask. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another mannequin, at the same cost as creating a new soulbound mannequin. The new mannequin retains its personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.

.. _`bestiary4.soulboundmannequin#susceptible_to_mind_affecting_effects`:

\ **Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex)**\  Unlike most constructs, a soulbound mannequin is not immune to mind-affecting effects.

A soulbound mannequin is a human-sized improvement on the :ref:`soulbound doll <bestiary2.soulbounddoll#soulbound_doll>`\ . The binding process is sophisticated enough to leave much of the soul's personality intact. Most are crafted to allow a faithful servant to remain with a prestigious family or to allow a dying loved one to remain among the living in a limited way. Because the mannequin's face is expressionless and its voice has little inflection, it carries several masks that it uses to convey emotions. It often serves its creator as a bodyguard, companion, servant, sentry, or even paramour.

.. _`bestiary4.soulboundmannequin#construction`:

Construction
*************

A soulbound mannequin is made from wood or porcelain, with one expertly carved mask worth at least 500 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul fragment from a creature who dies at some point during the creation of the mannequin (this doesn't prevent the rest of the soul from continuing on to the afterlife or prevent the body from later being revived). An unwilling soul can resist the procedure with a successful DC 20 Will save.
