=========

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  inquisitor 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any :ref:`magic jar <corerulebook.spells.magicjar#magic_jar>`\  effect (including a ghost's malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  spell, except :ref:`cast out <advancedplayersguide.spells.castout#cast_out>`\  can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or effect.
