Special Abilities
==================

\ **Hidey-Hole (Su)**\  When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she can create an extradimensional space by scrawling a sigil on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or other permanent object (such as a stove). This sigil serves as the entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the nearest empty square to the sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from the hidey-hole.

Kikimoras are house spirits who torment those with whom they live unless the poor folk cater to and cajole them. They delight in stressing homeowners by using illusion magic to make the house look much filthier than it actually is; their favored illusions are those of scuttling vermin.

Kikimoras are enemies of brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras often invite pain and frustration on their chosen housemates instead of helping chores along. Some brownies actively seek out kikimora-infested homes with the intention of driving out the disruptive fey creatures. When homeowners refuse to appease a resident kikimora (or can't rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora visits upon them a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Because of the subtle tricks these fey employ, inhabitants in homes plagued by kikimoras often believe they have been beset by ghosts.

Kikimoras love secretly breaking things or making such destruction seem like an accident. They proceed to trick the people in the house into leaving gifts in return for making repairs at night, much to the indignation of brownies, who view such gifts as payments for services rendered and resent the kikimoras' transformation of such agreements into coercion.
