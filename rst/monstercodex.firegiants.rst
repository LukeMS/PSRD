Fire Giants
************

When orc raiders ransack a sleepy countryside settlement, it's a tragedy; when fire giants do the same, the result is utter devastation. The distinction between an apocalypse and a raid by fire giants is semantics alone, as the conflagrations caused by these terrible warlords can consume villages, strongholds, and entire cities.

Fire giants simultaneously embody the tempered reserve of finely crafted steel and the fury of wildfires. They are both the most warlike and the most organized of the giant races. They are contemplative, strategic, and violent—a dangerous combination for those that fall beneath the fierce gaze of fire giant nobility and their bloodthirsty generals. Fire giants' military campaigns are always preceded by careful, lengthy deliberation. Their war rooms and courts churn with activity; indeed, the undercurrent of violence can be felt in every facet of fire giant society.

Numerous societies mention fire giants in their fables and histories, though never in a flattering light. Always portrayed as ruthless soldiers and cunning warlords, and often placed at the heart of devastating legends and stories of catastrophe, fire giants exemplify the horrors of war. This isn't because they're gifted with supernatural strength or because the boulders they hurl at their enemies smolder with heat and anger—those traits are accessories at best. The truth is far more dire than can be illustrated in any apocryphal myth or children's story: fire giants are intimately associated with war and destruction in lore and legend simply because they are strong and they despise the weak. Unfortunately for most of the world's other races, fire giants automatically perceive anything smaller than themselves as weak and pathetic.

Fire giants dwell among craggy mountains and rocky badlands. They make their workshops in the cores of volcanoes, powering their forges with energy tapped from flowing lava and quenching their blazing arms and armor with the blood of their quarry. The smog created by fire giants' immense smelting factories and smithies roils with lightning and thunder during the dry season, and the black soot that hangs over a fire giant settlement might be mistaken by smaller folk for volcano smoke, though few lowland dwellers hold this misconception for long.

Love is a mostly foreign concept among fire giants. Procreation occurs rarely, and often only as a by-product of other passions—a fire giant might feel the stir of desire after a glorious battlefield victory or the public decapitation of a reviled enemy, for instance. Conception is celebrated in the clan, but only because the birth of a strong child means another hearty warrior to add to the fire giants' ranks.

The formative years of a fire giant's life are as marked by war as are the lives of the adults in the tribe. From birth, a youth is outfitted in custom-forged armor that is remolded and replaced as needed to fit the youngster's growing frame. It takes nearly half a century for a fire giant to reach adulthood; this period is a time of endless, brutal, bloody training. Sparring matches and competitions of strength are common measures of young fire giants' skill and promise. Tribal leaders watch such matches carefully, ever on the lookout for prospective future generals. They also identify those who are to be relegated to lesser positions in the tribe, and weaklings destined to be culled from the group. Fire giant society has no room for those who cannot pull their own weight. All young fire giants must demonstrate their worth by surviving for a time in exile outside the tribe's holdings, or die trying.

Fire giants revel in warfare on any scale. Massacres and genocides entertain these hungry brutes as much as do small-scale skirmishes or one-on-one wrestling bouts. Of course, the battles that result in the most spilled blood are the ones that make it into fire giants' own oral legends. They have virtually no written lore, because they consider transcribing tales of warfare a waste of time—to fire giants, writing is best used to tally the deaths of their foes, count their mounds of pillaged riches, and catalog the slaves captured from the latest raid. Such bookkeeping is usually the work of enslaved scribes, so that no fire giants need sully their hands with ink or paper.

Possibly the only factor that has stopped fire giants from spreading to the farthest corners of the globe and dominating entire nations is their fractious nature—their clans and tribes are constantly at odds with one another. Even in regions where fire giant rule is already practically ensured, rival clans might be unable to secure control if they cannot select a single ruler to unify and guide them. Their quick tempers and great pride makes treaties and alliances rare, and more than once a powerful fire giant kingdom has crumbled beneath the weight of such arrogance.

Battles between fire giant clans are dramatic spectacles to behold—gouts of lava burst from the earth as magmablades call upon their fell flame magic, and steam hog-riding cavalry create veritable earthquakes as they charge headlong into the fiery fray. Such skirmishes might take place anywhere—location makes no difference to feuding fire giants. Woe betide any innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of these epic clashes; entire settlements have been obliterated in the collateral damage of a fire giant feud.

Fire giants hold might as the surest way to determine one's right to rule. Rulers who do not impose their strength upon those beneath them are weak and deserve to be deposed, while those who enforce their will by fear and brawn are formidable kings and queens indeed. The monarchic structure of fire giant society ensures that the lowest members of the clan know their place among the forges and the anvils, and it entrenches members of the nobility in the upper echelons of this brutish hierarchy.

New Rules
##########

The following section presents a new oracle mystery, new feats, and new magic items common among fire giants.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#fire_giant_oracle_mystery`:

Fire Giant Oracle Mystery
**************************

Among fire giants, the rare but blessed oracles of the apocalypse are favored emissaries of the divine.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#apocalypse`:

Apocalypse
===========

\ **Class Skills**\ : An oracle with the apocalypse mystery adds :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ , :ref:`Disguise <corerulebook.skills.disguise#disguise>`\ , :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\ , and :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  to her list of class skills.

\ **Bonus Spells**\ : :ref:`deathwatch <corerulebook.spells.deathwatch#deathwatch>`\   (2nd), :ref:`summon swarm <corerulebook.spells.summonswarm#summon_swarm>`\  (4th), :ref:`explosive runes <corerulebook.spells.explosiverunes#explosive_runes>`\   (6th), :ref:`ice storm <corerulebook.spells.icestorm#ice_storm>`\  (8th), :ref:`insect plague <corerulebook.spells.insectplague#insect_plague>`\  (10th), :ref:`circle of death <corerulebook.spells.circleofdeath#circle_of_death>`\  (12th), :ref:`vision <corerulebook.spells.vision#vision>`\  (14th), :ref:`incendiary cloud <corerulebook.spells.incendiarycloud#incendiary_cloud>`\  (16th), :ref:`meteor swarm <corerulebook.spells.meteorswarm#meteor_swarm>`\   (18th).

\ **Revelations**\ : An oracle with the apocalypse mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#defy_elements`:

\ *Defy Elements (Ex)*\  : Choose one energy type (acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic). You gain resistance 5 to the selected energy type. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can choose an additional energy type for which to gain resistance 5, or you can choose a previously chosen energy type and increase that resistance by 5 (to a maximum resistance of 20 for any one energy type).

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#destructive_roots`:

\ *Destructive Roots (Su)*\  : You can root yourself to your current spot and cause the world around you to fall apart. As a standard action, you can cause the ground in a 5-foot radius burst centered on you to crumble and rupture, becoming difficult terrain. As a move action on subsequent rounds, you can continue to concentrate on this area as though concentrating on a spell; doing so increases the radius of difficult terrain by 5 feet (maximum 30-foot-radius).You immediately cease concentrating if you move from the square you started in when you activated this ability. Difficult terrain created by this ability remains for 24 hours before returning to its original state. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#doomsayer`:

\ *Doomsayer (Su)*\  : As a standard action, you can utter a dire prophecy that strikes fear in your enemies and causes them to become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to hear you. This effect persists as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and you use a move action each round to continue your doomsaying. This ability cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the target was already shaken from another effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components. At 15th level, continuing your doomsaying each round is a swift action instead. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#dust_to_dust`:

\ *Dust to Dust (Su)*\  : Once per day as a standard action, you can cause the weapons around you to shatter in their wielders' hands. When you use this ability, attempt a single sunder combat maneuver, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your Charisma modifier in place of Strength. Every creature except you in a 10-foot radius that is wielding a manufactured weapon is targeted by the same attempt. You deal an amount of damage to each weapon affected equal to 1d4 × your Charisma modifier (minimum 1d4). At 11th level, this damage increases to 1d6 × your Charisma modifier (minimum 1d6). At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#erosion_touch`:

\ *Erosion Touch (Su)*\  : As the nature mystery revelation.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#near_death`:

\ *Near Death (Su)*\  : As the bones mystery revelation.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#pass_the_torch`:

\ *Pass the Torch (Su)*\  : Once per day as a swift action, you can channel the energy of the apocalypse into your body, causing you to ignite. You take 1d4 points of fire damage when you activate this ability and again at the beginning of your turn until you end the effect. Any creature that begins its turn adjacent to you takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the fire spreads, plus 1 additional point of fire damage for each previous round you have had this ability active. For example, adjacent creatures take 1d6+5 points of damage if you have had this ability active for 5 rounds. You can use this ability for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level, and you can end this ability as a free action. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can use this ability one additional time per day.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#power_of_the_fallen`:

\ *Power of the Fallen (Sp)*\  : You can touch a dying creature and channel its life energy into another living creature. This ability acts as :ref:`death knell <corerulebook.spells.deathknell#death_knell>`\ , except you can choose any ally (including yourself) within 30 feet to gain the benefit of this effect, and you can apply the +2 enhancement bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#spell_blast`:

\ *Spell Blast (Su)*\  : As a swift action whenever you confirm a critical hit against an opponent with a spell that requires an attack roll, you can immediately attempt to bull rush your opponent in any direction. You don't provoke an attack of opportunity for this bull rush attempt.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#unstoppable_overrun`:

\ *Unstoppable Overrun (Ex)*\  : You can attempt overrun combat maneuvers against opponents that are up to two size categories larger than you. At 5th level, you gain :ref:`Improved Overrun <corerulebook.feats#improved_overrun>`\  as a bonus feat. At 10th level, you gain :ref:`Greater Overrun <corerulebook.feats#greater_overrun>`\  as a bonus feat. You don't need to meet the prerequisites to gain these feats.

\ **Final Revelation**\ : Upon reaching 20th level, you become a herald of the apocalypse and wield the awesome power to fulfill such prophecy. Anytime you successfully cast a spell or use an ability that bestows 1 or more negative levels, the effect bestows 1d4 additional negative levels. Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a creature (including with a melee, ranged, or spell attack), as a swift action you can curse the target of your attack, as the :ref:`bestow curse <corerulebook.spells.bestowcurse#bestow_curse>`\  spell, except the target doesn't receive a Will saving throw to negate the effects and spell resistance does not apply against this ability.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#fire_giant_feat`:

Fire Giant Feat
****************

Fire giant warriors have access to the following feat.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#smoking_boulder`:

Smoking Boulder
================

The boulders you hurl burn so hot that they smoke.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Base attack bonus +11, heated rock special ability.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you throw a rock as part of an attack action and hit your target, you can cause the boulder to emit a 10-foot-radius spread of heavy smoke. The smoke lasts for 1d4 rounds.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#fire_giant_magic_items`:

Fire Giant Magic Items
***********************

The \ *burning*\  weapon special ability and \ *steaming*\  armor special ability add the power of fire and steam to the arms and armor of fire giants.

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#burning_weapon_special_ability`: `monstercodex.firegiants#burning`_

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#burning`:

Burning
========

\ **Price**\  +2 bonus; \ **Aura**\  strong evocation; \ **CL**\  12th; \ **Weight**\  —

A \ *burning*\  weapon causes an unattended flammable object to ignite when struck (Fortitude DC 13 negates for magic items), dealing 1d6+1 points of fire damage to the object each round after it's ignited. An item made mostly or entirely out of wood is even more susceptible to this effect, taking 2d6+2 points of fire damage. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A creature that ends its turn in the same space as a burning object takes 1d6+1 points of fire damage.

Up to three times per day, the bearer of a \ *burning*\  weapon can, on command, cause a single object that has been ignited by the weapon to burn even brighter, increasing the duration of its burning effect by 1d4+1 rounds and causing the fire to expand in a burst that extends 5 feet from the object. This burst of fire deals 1d6+1 points of fire damage to each creature in that area, and it can ignite unattended flammable objects within that area as if they had been hit with the weapon.

Fire giants often make use of \ *burning*\  weapons in their fervid crusades against other races. 

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#construction_requirements`:

Construction Requirements

\ **Cost**\  +2 bonus

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#steaming_armor_special_ability`: `monstercodex.firegiants#steaming`_

.. _`monstercodex.firegiants#steaming`:

Steaming
=========

\ **Price**\  +2 bonus; \ **Aura**\  faint evocation; \ **CL**\  3rd; \ **Weight**\  —

A suit of \ *steaming*\  armor features numerous sliding plates and movable pieces to aid in ventilation. Three times per day, the wearer of \ *steaming*\  armor can speak a command word that causes the armor to emit a cloud of scorching steam. The steam lasts for 5 rounds or until the wearer dismisses it by speaking a second command word.

When the wearer speaks the command word and at the start of the wearer's turn during subsequent rounds, the steam deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature grappling the wearer or occupying the wearer's square (though not to the wearer) and 1 point of damage to any creature within a 5-foot-radius burst of the wearer (except for those that have already taken damage because they are grappling the wearer). While the \ *steaming*\  ability is active, a creature that is within 5 feet of the wearer that makes a melee attack or attempts a combat maneuver against the wearer must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage.

The \ *steaming*\  armor special ability can be applied only to medium and heavy armors.

Fire giant kings rule over their volcanic dominions with a cruel and heavy hand. Most kings seek the hand of a queen to reign beside them, both to secure their own power and to provide heirs to accede to their thrones when they inevitably fall in battle. A fire giant king must always watch his back, however, for there are always claimants eager to seize his position.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Steam Cloud (Ex)**\ As a standard action, a steam hog can emit a cloud of steam from its snout in a 10-foot-radius spread. The initial burst of steam deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature in the area. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius :ref:`obscuring mist <corerulebook.spells.obscuringmist#obscuring_mist>`\  . Any creature that begins its turn in the area of the steam must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. A steam hog can use its steam cloud only once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The military advancements of fire giants aren't restricted only to arms and armor—just as ore is dredged from the mountains for these giants' cruel forges, animals are culled from the wilds to serve as fire giant weaponry. In addition to using hell hounds, red dragons, and other fiery fauna for their brutal campaigns, fire giants have created several unique species of war beasts all their own. Chief among these amalgamations of flesh and steel are the malformed swine known as steam hogs—enormous snorting brutes charged with heading the front lines of fire giant armies, each one capable of laying low an entire platoon of enemy soldiers.

While fire giants are more than capable of crafting new armor for their steam hogs, they take great pleasure in bedecking their prized war beasts with the reforged arms and armor of their vanquished foes. In this way, the armor and accoutrements of a veteran steam hog serve as a record of the battles and wars the beast has fought in. When such a steam hog falls in battle, its armor—and thus its history—are often kept by sentimental fire giant handlers as treasured heirlooms.

Steam hogs average 16 feet long from snout to tail and 8 feet tall at the shoulder. They can weigh up to 3 tons, or 4 tons when equipped with adamantine scale barding.
