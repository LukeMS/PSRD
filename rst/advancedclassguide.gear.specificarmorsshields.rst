Specific Armors and Shields
############################

The following section includes armors and shields with unusual powers and magical abilities. Magic armors can have either abilities that need to be activated to function or powers that work passively and constantly.

Clawhand Shield
================

\ **Price**\  8,158 gp; \ **Slot**\ shield; \ **CL**\  9th; \ **Weight**\  8 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate necromancy

This shield is made of bone and ivory, but has been imbued with magic to function as a +2 mithral heavy steel :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\  (though it is not considered to be made of metal). The shield has stylized animal claws encircling its outer rim. If the wearer is grappled, pinned, or swallowed whole, as a standard action he can cause the claws to animate and make a single melee attack dealing 1d8 points of damage + the wielder's Strength modifier (1d6 + his Strength modifier for a Small wielder) without requiring a successful combat maneuver check to do so. This is considered a weapon attack with a one-handed weapon the wielder is proficient with, not a shield bash.

Additionally, the claws can animate to perform the somatic components of a spell as long as the arm holding the shield would be able to provide these components if it weren't carrying a shield. As a result, the shield has no arcane spell failure chance.

Full Plate of the Corpse
=========================

\ **Price**\  35,650 gp; \ **Slot**\ armor; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  50 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  faint abjuration

This suit of \ *+2 full plate*\  has been etched and stained in such a way that it resembles the form and shape of a decomposed body that is encased in a suit of armor. The wearer is effectively hidden from non-intelligent undead, which can't see, hear, or smell him; even extraordinary or supernatural senses capabilities can't penetrate the magical shroud. An intelligent undead creature can attempt a single Will saving throw (DC 14) to penetrate the ward. All affected undead behave as if the wearer simply isn't there.

Hero's Hauberk
===============

\ **Price**\  16,600 gp; \ **Slot**\ armor; \ **CL**\  13th; \ **Weight**\  25 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  strong abjuration

The damage reduction of this dull gray \ *+1 adamantine chain shirt*\  stacks with any other damage reduction the wearer possesses. For example, a wearer with DR 5/magic would reduce damage from nonmagical attacks by 6, and magical attacks by 1. While the wearer rages or maintains a raging song, the armor emits a low droning sound and grants the benefits of :ref:`light <corerulebook.spells.light#light>`\  :ref:`fortification <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_fortification>`\ .

While the wearer maintains a bardic performance, the armor's links jangle in harmony with his song or movements, aiding his focus. The wearer receives a +1 luck bonus on all ability checks and skill checks he attempts during such a performance. In addition, any penalties applied to his attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws are reduced by 1. If a die roll has multiple penalties, the total of the penalties is reduced by 1, not each individual penalty.

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  11,850 GP

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, :ref:`limited wish <corerulebook.spells.limitedwish#limited_wish>`\  or :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\ , creator must have the raging song class feature

.. _`advancedclassguide.gear.specificarmorsshields#stalking_armor`:

Stalking Armor
===============

\ **Price**\  8,575 gp; \ **Slot**\ armor; \ **CL**\  6th; \ **Weight**\  20 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

This \ *+2 studded leather armor*\  comes in a number of varieties, each corresponding to a specific type of terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. The armor takes on visual characteristics related to that type of terrain (cold \ *stalking*\  armor might be gray and white with a white fur trim, jungle \ *stalking*\  armor could be lush green with vine patterns, and so on) and makes the wearer blend in more naturally with his surroundings. The stalking armor grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  and :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks attempted while in that specific terrain.

Construction Requirements
==========================

\ **Cost**\  4,375 gp

Tireless Tracking Hide
=======================

\ **Price**\  11,165 gp; \ **Slot**\ armor; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  25 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation

This \ *+1 hide armor*\  is always made from the pelt of a migratory herd animal. Anyone wearing this armor can maintain a hustle for a full 8 hours without growing fatigued, doubling her normal daily overland movement rate. After that, the wearer begins to take nonlethal damage each hour, per the hustle rules (\ *Core Rulebook*\  171). This armor does not increase tactical movement during combat. The benefits of this armor aren't replenished until the character has had a full night's rest.
