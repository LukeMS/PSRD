Muffle Sound
=============

\ **School**\  illusion (glamer); \ **Level**\  bard 2, cleric 2, inquisitor 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 round

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  1 ally/level

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ : Will negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\ : yes

You suppress sounds made by the targets, granting them a +4 bonus on :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks. The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components or using abilities that rely on audible components (such as some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper the targets' ability to hear other sounds and provides no protection against language-dependent or sonic spells and effects.
