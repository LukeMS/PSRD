Feat Index
###########

Feats represent special tricks or abilities a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his birth. They grant characters abilities that others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some feats specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most are available to anyone who meets the prerequisites.
