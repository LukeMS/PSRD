Haste
======

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a \ *speed*\  weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 :ref:`dodge bonus <corerulebook.combat#dodge_bonuses>`\  to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  and :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  saves. Any condition that makes you lose your :ref:`Dexterity <corerulebook.gettingstarted#dexterity>`\  bonus to :ref:`Armor Class <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  (if any) also makes you lose :ref:`dodge bonus <corerulebook.combat#dodge_bonuses>`\ es.

All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple \ *haste*\ effects don't stack. \ *Haste*\ dispels and counters :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\ .
