New Familiars
**************

The following are statistics for several new animals that can serve as familiars, in addition to a number of familiars :ref:` for the Witch Class <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.witch#witchs_familiar>`\ . These familiars can be taken by anyone gaining a familiar, and utilize all the standard rules for familiars :ref:`for Wizard familiars <corerulebook.classes.wizard#familiars>`\ . Tiny or smaller familiars in this section use Dexterity to modify :ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  and :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  skill checks.

Small and Vermin Familiars
***************************

Small-sized familiars threaten the areas around them like Small creatures, and can be used to flank enemies, though both familiars and their masters are often loath to use such tactics, as the result is often a dead familiar. Small-sized familiars are also harder to keep on a master's person than Tiny or smaller familiars. Often they require some form of magic item, like a :ref:`bag of holding <corerulebook.magicitems.wondrousitems#bag_of_holding>`\ , for such a feat to work. The process of making a vermin into a familiar grants it an Intelligence score and removes the mindless trait. Vermin familiars communicate with their masters and other vermin of their kind (greensting scorpions with other scorpions, house centipedes with other centipedes, and scarlet spiders with other spiders) by way of a strange combination of behaviors, slight changes in coloration, and even the excretion of scents, subtle and otherwise. As with other types of familiars, other creatures cannot understand this communication without magical aid.

Special Abilities
==================

.. _`ultimatemagic.magic.newfamiliars#shell_retreat`:

\ **Shell Retreat (Ex)**\  A turtle can retreat within its shell as a swift action, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor. While in its shell, a turtle cannot take any action except to end the retreat. The turtle can end its retreat with a free action on its turn.

Turtles are slow-moving reptiles with hard shells that they can retreat into when threatened. Many turtles have flippers and are better suited for swimming than walking. These statistics can also be used for tortoises, which have feet instead of flippers and live in arid regions.
