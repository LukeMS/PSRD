Feats
######

Feats represent special tricks and edges that characters have acquired though training, luck, or a quirk of birth.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#types_of_feats`:

Types of Feats
***************

Though most of the feats presented in this section are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to a type or types of feats that share special rules. A feat's types appear in parentheses after the feat's name. This section features the following types of feats.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#combat_feats`:

Combat Feats
=============

Some classes can select combat feats as bonus feats. Members of other classes can take combat feats provided they meet the prerequisites.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#metamagic_feats`:

Metamagic Feats
================

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells, :ref:`see here <corerulebook.feats#metamagic_feats>`\ .

.. _`occultadventures.feats#stare_feats`:

Stare Feats
============

Stare feats allow a mesmerist to apply additional effects to his painful stare ability. Characters without the Compounded Pain feat can apply the effects of only one stare feat to an individual attack; a mesmerist with multiple stare feats must choose which to apply before the damage roll is made.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#teamwork_feats`:

Teamwork Feats
===============

Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide their benefits only if the given conditions are met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act don't count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don't have those feats.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#feat_descriptions`:

Feat Descriptions
******************

The feats in this section are summarized in the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' descriptions for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

\ **Feat Name**\ : The name entry indicates the feat's name as well as what type, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : This entry gives the required minimum ability score, other feats, minimum base attack bonus, minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat can have more than one prerequisite. Many prerequisites—such as classes, class abilities, and feats—can be found elsewhere in this book.

\ **Benefit**\ : This entry describes what a feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character takes the same feat more than once, its benefits don't stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

\ **Normal**\ : This entry states what a character who doesn't have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. It is typically included when a feat interacts with rules systems in an unusual way.

\ **Special**\ : Additional unusual facts about the feat, if any, appear here.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#alter_bindary_minscape`: `occultadventures.feats#alter_binary_mindscape`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#alter_binary_mindscape`:

Alter Binary Mindscape
=======================

You can shift and change a binary mindscape to your advantage during a psychic duel.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Int 13, ability to cast :ref:`instigate psychic duel <occultadventures.spells.instigatepsychicduel#instigate_psychic_duel>`\ .

\ **Benefit**\ : When you cast :ref:`instigate psychic duel <occultadventures.spells.instigatepsychicduel#instigate_psychic_duel>`\  and create a binary mindscape, the arena you create puts your enemy at a disadvantage. Your opponent must spend 1 more manifestation point than normal when creating any defensive manifestations.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#bleeding_stare`: `occultadventures.feats#bleeding_stare_(combat_stare)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#bleeding_stare_(combat_stare)`:

Bleeding Stare (Combat, Stare)
===============================

Your stare causes your foe to bleed out of its eyes.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Mesmerist level 5th, painful stare class feature.

\ **Benefits**\ : When you trigger your painful stare, the target takes an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/3 your mesmerist level. Bleed damage from multiple uses of Bleeding Stare doesn't stack.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#chakra_adept`:

Chakra Adept
=============

Your body and soul have grown more accustomed to kundalini energy.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Chakra Initiate, ability to awaken the heart chakra.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 4 points. When you maintain your chakras as a swift action without opening a new chakra, you can choose to attempt either the Fortitude save or the Will save instead of both.

In addition, after you stop spending ki to maintain your chakras, the kundalini energy lingers in your body. On the first round during which you spend no ki to maintain your chakras, your highest chakra closes and you can spend a swift action to use any one of the abilities of your remaining open chakras. On the next round after that, all of your chakras close, and you must spend 1 point of ki and a swift action to start again from your root chakra.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#chakra_initiate`:

Chakra Initiate
================

You have an extra wellspring of kundalini energy that you can use to open your chakras.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Ability to awaken the root chakra.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a pool that holds 3 points of serpent-fire ki, which you can use only to open or maintain chakras. These serpent-fire ki points are replenished at the same time you replenish the points in your regular ki pool.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#chakra_master`:

Chakra Master
==============

You have mastered all seven chakras, and use your ki to pull more power from the kundalini flow.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Chakra Adept, Chakra Initiate, ability to awaken the crown chakra.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 5 points. You can spend 3 ki points instead of 1 when you open or maintain a chakra to gain the benefits of two chakras instead of one in that round. If you are opening or maintaining your crown chakra, this stacks with the crown chakra's special power, allowing you to gain the benefits of three chakras in a round.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#compounded_pain`: `occultadventures.feats#compounded_pain_(combat)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#compounded_pain_(combat)`:

Compounded Pain (Combat)
=========================

Your painful stare causes two additional effects.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Mesmerist level 13th, painful stare class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can apply the effects of two stare feats to your painful stares.

\ **Normal**\ : You can apply the effects of only one stare feat to a given painful stare.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#delay_blast`:

Delay Blast
============

You can delay your kinetic blasts.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Base attack bonus +3, kinetic blast class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you use a kinetic blast, you can specify a number of rounds between 1 and 5. When that number of rounds has passed, the kinetic blast takes effect at the beginning of your turn. In the interim, you can take a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to cause the blast to take effect earlier than you initially selected. If you delay another blast while you already have a delayed blast pending, the previous delayed blast dissipates harmlessly.

You must make any decisions you would make about the delayed blast—including designating target positions, choosing infusions, and determining or shaping the area—when you first use the blast. The blast originates from your position at the time you used the blast, not your current position when the blast takes effect, and it targets the position or area you had specified (which may or may not include any targets). A delayed blast radiates an aura of magic appropriate for its spell level even while it is delayed, and during that time, it can be dispelled by :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ .

.. _`occultadventures.feats#demoralizing_stare`: `occultadventures.feats#demoralizing_stare_(combat_stare)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#demoralizing_stare_(combat_stare)`:

Demoralizing Stare (Combat, Stare)
===================================

Your painful stare inspires fear in your foes.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Mesmerist level 9th, painful stare class feature.

\ **Benefits**\ : When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become frightened, even if the target is already shaken.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#disciplinary_devotee`:

Disciplinary Devotee
=====================

Your careful study of mental magic grants you mastery in your discipline.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Psychic discipline class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks and concentration checks when casting spells from your psychic discipline, and you gain a +1 insight bonus on saving throws against spells from your discipline.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#distant_delivery`:

Distant Delivery
=================

Your phantom can deliver spells at a greater range than usual.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Phantom class feature, phantom with the deliver touch spells ability.

\ **Benefit**\ : The distance from you at which your phantom can deliver touch spells increases by 20 feet.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#efficient_focus_shift`:

Efficient Focus Shift
======================

You are more adept than most at shifting mental focus between your implements.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Occultist level 7th.

\ **Benefit**\ : Twice per day when you shift mental focus from one implement to another, you can add the same number of points to the latter implement that you removed from the former.

\ **Normal**\ : By removing points of mental focus from one implement, you can add the same amount – 1 to another.

\ **Special**\ : You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#elongated_cranium`:

Elongated Cranium
==================

You have undergone the painful and ancient art of cranial binding, deforming your skull to unlock the hidden potential of your psychic self.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your cranium has been tightly bound with boards and wrappings to change its shape and attune your mind to your psychic discipline. If you take this feat after 1st level, you must undergo a painful 6-month regimen of increased tightening and head binding, during which you take a –1 penalty on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. Once the binding is completed, your skull takes on one of three shapes of your choosing, each with a specific benefit. Once chosen, this shape cannot be changed.

\ *Fronto-Occipital Elongation*\ : Your head slopes severely in a high conical shape, tapering from your brow to the crown of your head. You take a –1 penalty on Intelligence and Wisdom checks and on Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, once per day, you can extend the duration of a psychic spell you cast by 50% (minimum 0 additional rounds). The increased duration doesn't stack with the increase granted by the Extend Spell feat.

\ *Ovoid Compression*\ : Your head takes on a larger, more bulbous appearance than normal. You take a –1 penalty on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, once per day you can cast one psychic magic spell you know with a +1 bonus to its caster level.

\ *Sagittal Elongation:*\  Your head slopes back in a gentle, elongated curve. You take a –1 penalty on Intelligence and Charisma checks and on Intelligence- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. In addition, once per day, you can increase the DC of a psychic spell you cast by 1.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#emotional_conduit`:

Emotional Conduit
==================

The deep emotional resonance you share with your phantom enables you to master the emotions of others.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Shared consciousness class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain familiarity with a number of additional spells based on the emotional focus of your phantom. These spells are added to both your class spell list (if not already on that list) and your list of spells known; they are in addition to the normal number of spells known for your level.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#empath`:

Empath
=======

You have learned how to psychically sense an individual's mood or altered mental state.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells, :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  1 rank or :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  1 rank.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can use either :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  or :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  when reading an emotion aura with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature's emotion aura takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\ ). You don't learn the source of the effect or the actual effect.

You can also use the read aura occult skill unlock to read emotion auras more than once per day by opening your innate mental defenses. For 1 minute after you use this feat, you take a –4 penalty on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects (regardless of whether you succeeded at the check). During this time, you're also unable to attempt to read emotion auras. Using this feat doesn't use up your one daily use of the read aura unlock, which you can still use either to read another type of aura or to read an emotion aura without taking the penalty associated with this feat.

If the ally moves outside of the extended power's range, the power is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the ally moves within range again. You can spend 1 point of mental focus from your implement to pass the effect to a new target, so long as both the original target and the new one are within 30 feet.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#fatiguing_stare`: `occultadventures.feats#fatiguing_stare_(combat_stare)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#fatiguing_stare_(combat_stare)`:

===========================

Your spells inspire great fear in those harmed by them.

\ **Benefit**\ : When a creature takes damage from a fearsome spell, if that creature failed its save against the spell, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If the spell effect already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell. A fearsome spell can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken. A fearsome spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#focused_phantom`:

Focused Phantom
================

Furious Spell (Metamagic)
==========================

Your spells seethe with the ferocious intensity of your blood-red rage.

\ **Benefit**\ : A furious spell that deals hit point damage adds twice the spell's original level to the amount of damage dealt by the spell.

In addition, a furious spell can be cast while the caster is enraged, including during a barbarian rage or while affected by a :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage>`\  spell. Even a furious spell that requires an emotion component can be cast while enraged. The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks related to casting a furious spell if she is enraged. A furious spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#greater_mesmerizing_feint`: `occultadventures.feats#greater_mesmerizing_feint_(combat)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#greater_mesmerizing_feint_(combat)`:

You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and :ref:`forbiddance <corerulebook.spells.forbiddance#forbiddance>`\  keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal effects.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#implement_focus`:

Implement Focus
================

You are more adept at spending generic focus on focus powers from your chosen school.

This damage increases to 2d6 at mesmerist level 12th and to 3d6 at mesmerist level 18th.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#interweave_composite_blast`: `occultadventures.feats#interweave_composite_blast_(combat_teamwork)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#interweave_composite_blast_(combat_teamwork)`:

Interweave Composite Blast (Combat, Teamwork)
==============================================

You can combine your blasts with those of another kineticist.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Kinetic blast class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : Whenever you are within 15 feet of another character who has this feat, you can ready an action to activate a simple blast of your choice. When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6th-level hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage).

One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast.

If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast).

The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can use :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts>`\  at will as a spell-like ability against a host creature you possess. The host receives no saving throw, and the effect functions as if you had concentrated for 3 rounds. You can also use :ref:`seek thoughts <advancedplayersguide.spells.seekthoughts#seek_thoughts>`\  on your host as a spell-like ability once during the possession. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the DC of the original possession effect. If the host succeeds, the effect fails and the host become aware of the possession if it wasn't already.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#intuitive_spell`: `occultadventures.feats#intuitive_spell_(metamagic)`_

.. _`occultadventures.feats#intuitive_spell_(metamagic)`:

============================

You can avoid the need for thought components by trusting your instincts.

\ **Benefit**\ : An intuitive spell can be cast with no thought components. Spells without thought components are not affected. An intuitive spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#kinetic_counter`:

Kinetic Counter
================

You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy's opposing elemental abilities.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Cold simple blast, fire simple blast, or water simple blast; kinetic blast class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent's elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ . Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability's effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon's breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon's effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again.â©

Kinetic Leap
=============

Kinetic energy propels you when you jump.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  3 ranks, kinetic blast class feature.

Logical Spell (Metamagic)
==========================

You can eschew emotional components by exercising logic.

\ **Benefit**\ : A logical spell can be cast without emotion components. Spells that don't require emotion components are not affected. A logical spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

\ **Benefit**\ : Upon completion of your possession, you can alter up to 5 minutes of your host's memories as you see fit. This functions as the :ref:`modify memory <corerulebook.spells.modifymemory#modify_memory>`\  spell. Your host's awareness of the possession doesn't impact this ability, and if your control of the host lasted less than 5 minutes, you can cause it to forget the possession entirely. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to that of the original possession effect to resist this alteration.

.. _`occultadventures.feats#mesmerizing_feint`: `occultadventures.feats#mesmerizing_feint_(combat)`_
