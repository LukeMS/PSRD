Forest Friend
==============

\ **School**\  abjuration: \ **Level**\  druid 2, ranger 2

\ **Casting Time**\ : 1 round

\ **Components**\ : V, S, M (a pinch of manure)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  one willing living creature per three levels, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart. 

\ **Duration**\ : 1 minute/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ : none; \ **Spell Resistance**\ : no

 While subject to this spell, the targets find that forested areas become helpful instead of hindering. The targets suffer no hindrances to movement and suffer no penalties on :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  and :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks from undergrowth in forested terrain. Furthermore, forested overgrowth imposes a miss chance 10% lower than normal. 

When moving in and among trees, those subject to the spell gain a +5 circumstance bonus on :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks and :ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  checks. Rangers in their favored terrain can also add their favored terrain bonus on such :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  and :ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  checks.
