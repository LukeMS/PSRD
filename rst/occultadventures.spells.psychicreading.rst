You are able to read a person's surface thoughts and take cues from the person's appearance, body language, and manner of speech to infer a great deal of information about the person, even if that person is in disguise (including polymorph effects). When casting the spell, attempt a DC 20 :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check with a bonus equal to your caster level. A successful skill check reveals to you one of the following pieces of information of your choice, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds 20: age, alignment, class, feats, gender, native language, place of origin, race or ethnicity, racial traits, religion, sexual orientation, or training in a :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\ , :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\ , or :ref:`Profession <corerulebook.skills.profession#profession>`\  skill. For items marked with a cross (†), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece of information.

There's a 70% chance that all information you receive is correct. This roll is made secretly. Otherwise, on a roll of 71–80, you receive one false piece of information, on a roll of 81–90 you receive two, and on a roll of 91–100 you receive three. You can't get more false information than the total number of pieces of information you discover.
