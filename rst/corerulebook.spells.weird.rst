Weird
======

\ **School**\  illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 9

\ **Targets**\  any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like :ref:`phantasmal killer <corerulebook.spells.phantasmalkiller#phantasmal_killer>`\ , except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.

If a subject's :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is :ref:`stunned <corerulebook.glossary#stunned>`\  for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  damage.
