Mythic Feats
#############

Mythic characters and monsters gain mythic feats as they gain tiers or ranks. These feats can be selected only as part of mythic advancement, not as part of a character's normal advancement or in place of any other bonus feat.

Most mythic feats require a non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. These mythic feats enhance the benefits of their prerequisite feats, making them truly awe-inspiring. If a character doesn't possess any of the necessary prerequisite feats when she gains a mythic feat, she can wait to select a mythic feat until the next time she gains a tier or level.

A value in a mythic feat based on a fraction of your tier (such as a +1 bonus for every 3 tiers you possess) always has a minimum of 1.

This section includes some non-mythic feats. These grant a character who hasn't had a moment of ascension a measure of mythic might, and remain relevant if that character later becomes mythic.

Types of Feats
***************

Many feats belong to a category that has special rules associated to it. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this section.

.. _`mythicadventures.mythicfeats#metamagic_feats`:

Metamagic Feats
================

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.

Mythic Feats
=============

Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn't lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.

Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript "M" in the feat line of its stat block.

Feat Descriptions
******************

Mythic feats are summarized in the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feat descriptions for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

\ **Feat Name**\ : The feat's name also indicates what category, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite. Being a mythic character or monster is always a prerequisite for a mythic feat.

\ **Benefit**\ : What the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

\ **Normal**\ : What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

\ **Special**\ : Additional unusual facts about the feat.

Your rearing mount can stomp foes into the ground, barely breaking stride.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you use :ref:`Turn Undead <corerulebook.feats#turn_undead>`\ , the range increases by 10 feet per tier, and non-mythic undead take a penalty on their saving throws equal to your tier.

You destroy 2d4 Hit Dice worth of undead per tier. Undead with the fewest HD are affected first; among undead with equal HD, those that are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No undead of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that aren't sufficient to affect an undead are wasted.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your mount is always considered to have a running start when using :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  to jump. You can expend one use of mythic power to grant your mount a +10 bonus on an :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  check, or a +20 bonus if the check is made to jump.

When making a mounted charge, you can guide your mount to leap over a foe between your starting position and the target of your charge. You make a :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  check or your mount makes an :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  check (whichever is lower) during the charge, using the rules for the leap task under the :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  skill. If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you jump over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, you can vault over your target while making a Ride-By Attack, allowing you to move over or through its space and continue moving on the opposite side of it. If your jump exceeds the target's height, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll for higher ground, and if any of your allies threatens the target, you treat the target as flanked for purposes of your Ride-By Attack.
