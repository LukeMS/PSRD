Liberating Command
===================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  bard 1, cleric 1, druid 1, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 immediate action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one creature

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\ yes (harmless)

 If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an :ref:`Escape Artist <corerulebook.skills.escapeartist#escape_artist>`\  check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum +20). This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using the :ref:`Escape Artist <corerulebook.skills.escapeartist#escape_artist>`\  skill (for example, if he were under the effects of a :ref:`hold person <corerulebook.spells.holdperson#hold_person>`\  spell or paralyzed by Strength damage).
