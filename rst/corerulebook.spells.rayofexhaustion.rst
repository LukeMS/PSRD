Ray of Exhaustion
==================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Effect**\  ray

\ **Duration**\  1 min./level

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  partial; see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately :ref:`exhausted <corerulebook.glossary#exhausted>`\  for the spell's duration. A successful :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save means the creature is only :ref:`fatigued <corerulebook.glossary#fatigued>`\ .

A character that is already :ref:`fatigued <corerulebook.glossary#fatigued>`\  instead becomes :ref:`exhausted <corerulebook.glossary#exhausted>`\ .

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already :ref:`exhausted <corerulebook.glossary#exhausted>`\ . Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
