Special Abilities
==================

\ **Delicious (Ex)**\  Ghorans take a -2 penalty on Escape Artist and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple against any creature that has a bite attack with the grab ability.

\ **Ghorus Seed (Ex)**\  As a full-round action, a ghoran can expel its ghorus seed from an orifice in its abdomen. If planted in fertile ground and left undisturbed for 2d6 days, the seed grows into a healthy duplicate of the original ghoran, save that the duplicate can reallocate all of its skill ranks upon sprouting. Once a ghoran expels its seed, it gains 1 negative level, and it dies as soon as its duplicate sprouts. This duplicate replaces the previous ghoran character.

\ **Light Dependent**\  Ghorans take 1d4 points of Constitution damage each day they go without exposure to sunlight.

\ **Past-Life Knowledge (Ex)**\  Ghorans remember memories encoded in their ghorus seed. They treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.

Ghorans arose from plant life created by advanced druidic magic to be an especially hardy and adaptive food source for humans. Over the centuries, the plants evolved sentience and ambulatory bodies that mimicked the appearance of humanoids as a method to discourage their enemies from hunting them and improve their chances of survival. Their creators did not imbue them with the ability to create more of the ghorus seeds that give them life, so ghorans are fanatically protective of these seeds and consider destroying them the worst of crimes.

Ghoran Characters
******************

Ghorans are defined by their class levels—they don't have racial Hit Dice. A ghoran's challenge rating is equal to her class level. Ghorans have the following racial traits.

\ **+2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, -2 Intelligence**\ : Ghorans are hardy and guileful, but process thoughts slowly.

\ **+2 Natural Armor**\ : Ghorans have tough, rugged skin.

\ **Plant**\ : Ghorans have the plant type.

\ **Delicious:**\  See above.

\ **Natural Magic**\ : Ghorans with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—\ *detect poison, goodberry*\  (created berries bud from the ghoran's own body), and :ref:`purify food and drink <corerulebook.spells.purifyfoodanddrink#purify_food_and_drink>`\ . The caster level is equal to the ghoran's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the ghoran's Charisma bonus.

\ **Ghorus Seed**\ : See above.

\ **Light Dependent**\ : See above.

\ **Past-Life Knowledge**\ : See above.

\ **Languages**\ : Ghorans begin play speaking Sylvan and Common. Ghorans with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages such as Druidic).
