Protection from Arrows
=======================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`protection from arrows <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromarrows#protection_from_arrows>`

The damage reduction increases to 15/magic. The maximum damage prevented by the spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150 points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the attacker is also protected by \ *mythic protection from arrows*\  and its spell completely prevents the damage from the rebounded attack, the weapon or projectile is destroyed.
