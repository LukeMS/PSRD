Special Abilities
==================

\ **Breath Weapon (Su)**\  A creature that successfully saves against the hag's breath weapon takes half damage and is not blinded.

\ **Ice Staff (Su)**\  Once per week, a winter hag can perform an hour-long ritual to create a staff made of black ice that is as hard as steel and functions as a +2 :ref:`frost <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_frost>`\  quarterstaff. A winter hag holding her ice staff can use :ref:`cone of cold <corerulebook.spells.coneofcold#cone_of_cold>`\  once per day as a spell-like ability. The staff melts after 1 week.

\ **Icewalking (Ex)**\  This ability works like the :ref:`spider climb <corerulebook.spells.spiderclimb#spider_climb>`\  spell, but the surfaces the hag climbs must be icy. The hag can move across icy surfaces without penalty and doesn't need to make :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to run or charge on ice.

\ **Snow Vision (Ex)**\  A winter hag can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and doesn't take any penalties on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks while in snow.

Winter hags are sadistic crones who haunt winter-blasted plains and rime-covered forests. They're exceptionally arrogant, and often use their magic to subjugate entire tribes of evil humanoids so they can rule over them as queens. These arrangements rarely last more than a few seasons, because no creature is truly safe from a winter hag's irrepressible appetite for warm, raw flesh. An ambitious winter hag might extort a village by causing constant snowfall until they give her children to eat or adults to become her slaves.

A typical winter hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

When a winter hag joins a coven, the coven adds :ref:`sculpt simulacrum <ultimatemagic.spells.sculptsimulacrum#sculpt_simulacrum>`\  and :ref:`simulacrum <corerulebook.spells.simulacrum#simulacrum>`\  to its spell-like abilities, and any member within 1 mile of the winter hag gains icewalking and snow vision.
