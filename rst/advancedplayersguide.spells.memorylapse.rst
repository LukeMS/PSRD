Memory Lapse
=============

\ **School**\  enchantment [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one living creature 

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\ , or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.
