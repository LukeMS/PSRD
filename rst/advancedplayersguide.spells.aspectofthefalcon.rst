Aspect of the Falcon
=====================

\ **School**\ transmutation (polymorph); \ **Level**\  druid 1, ranger 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level

You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19–20/×3. This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the :ref:`Improved Critical <corerulebook.feats#improved_critical>`\  feat or a :ref:`keen <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_keen>`\  weapon.
