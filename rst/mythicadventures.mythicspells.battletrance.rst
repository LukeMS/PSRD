Battle Trance
==============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`battle trance <advancedraceguide.coreraces.halforcs#battle_trance>`

The number of temporary hit points you gain increases to 2d6 + your caster level (maximum +10) + your tier. The morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases to +6.

\ **Augmented (5th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength, immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, and DR 5/epic.
