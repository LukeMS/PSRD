Kobolds
********

Creatures of deep, dark places, kobolds are masters of tunneling, mining, and setting traps. They despise those that would take advantage their relative physical weakness or steal the precious ores they mine, and thus devote themselves to creating elaborate mechanical defenses for their lairs. Adventurers attempting to storm a kobold den rarely see an actual kobold until after they've been assaulted by a wide variety of cleverly engineered cruelties. 

All kobolds claim to be related to dragons, yet while it's true that kobold scale colors often match those of chromatic dragons, dragons themselves don't reciprocate this feeling of kinship. A kobold who manages to convince a dragon of her worth often serves it as a clever trap-maker or flunky, in exchange for the honor and protection the dragon's presence affords.

When humanoids and kobolds mix, often as a result of mining operations, kobolds often get a reputation as thieves and nuisances because of their tendency to appear at night and abscond with anything the humans leave lying around. Anything from farming equipment to small animals is seen as fair game to kobolds, who argue that such confiscation is not theft, but rather simply making good use of items the humans clearly don't value properly.

As creatures of deep caverns and shadowed forests, kobolds have difficulty with light, and even a torch is uncomfortably bright to their eyes. Hence, though they are not naturally nocturnal, they rarely venture to the surface during the day.

Kobold settlements are elaborate affairs. Though the lairs are relatively small—generally comprising a few caverns that serve as living quarters, larders, and workshops—each lair is surrounded by a complex web of tunnels and crawlspaces, all packed with ingenious traps. To kobolds, the best battle is the one they never have to fight at all, so creating new traps is a constant (if somewhat paranoid) policy and pastime in kobold society.

Tied into this paranoia is kobolds' treatment of egg chambers. The average kobold has no idea where his tribes' eggs are stored until hatching—preventing him from revealing the location even under coercive or magical interrogation. Only the tribe's chieftain and the kobolds assigned to watch over the eggs know the truth, ensuring that if the tribe's complex is eventually overrun (seen as an inevitability by the fatalistic kobolds), enough eggs will survive to raise a new generation.

Kobolds' resentment of larger races burns fiercest toward dwarves, gnomes, and other races who tend to mine the mineral veins the kobolds consider theirs. Once a kobold tribe begins digging out precious metals or gems in an area, its members feel that anyone else digging in the same area is a thief. Even if a kobold mining operation accidentally breaks into an established dwarven city, the kobolds' sense of manifest destiny would likely lead them to see the dwarves as the interlopers.

Yet the resentment kobolds feel toward other races is nothing compared to their animosity toward other kobold tribes that intrude on their mining operations or partake of the food sources their tribe considers its own. The resulting wars are fierce, bloody, and swift, with both tribes attempting to slay as many opponents as possible until one chief dies. Once a tribe has lost its chief, the losing tribe's demoralized survivors become slaves to the victorious tribe, and are sent into the mines to harvest out all the minerals they can for their new masters. If adventurers manage to make it through a tribe's traps, it's inevitably these same slaves who are armed and sent to confront the threat, generally with little hope of winning the ensuing battle. Though some might wonder why kobolds condemned in this way don't turn on their masters, the sad truth is that those who want to rebel are usually cut down before their attempt gets off the ground.

Most kobold tribes are led by a single chieftain, whose authority is rarely questioned. If a kobold tribe is ruled by a non-kobold, such as a young dragon, a kobold chief is still in charge of carrying out the ruler's instructions and seeing to day-to-day administration. Chieftainship is usually decided through combat, though accidents involving traps are tacitly considered fair game.

Kobolds worship the dragon gods, and in many cases dragons themselves, seeing little difference between all-powerful deities and (to them) essentially all-powerful dragons. The dragons themselves tend to enjoy the constant, obsequious worship of their lesser cousins—though the occasional solitude-loving dragon may decide that a kobold supplicant makes a better meal than a servant—and kobolds' naturally ordered and hierarchical society makes it easy for a creature at the top to command them.

Although kobolds feel a particular kinship with chromatic dragons and have less affinity for metallic ones, kobold scale colors are not nearly as personality-defining as those of true dragons, though some tribes have superstitions and other beliefs about scale color. Color is inconsistent in kobold genes, and parents of one color may give birth to children of several different scale hues, leading to a full spectrum of the chromatic tones that have little or no correlation to abilities.

The few metallic-colored kobolds are an exception to this rule. Though no more good-inclined than their fellows, these metallic kobolds are seen as special or marked by some higher power, and often go on to become great chiefs or shamans. Of course, this marking is a double-edged sword, as not every chief wants a potential usurper hanging around, and even those tribes who seek honestly to make use of their "blessed" members may subject them to a battery of dangerous tests in order to ascertain what powers these individuals might possess.

Full statistics for kobolds can be found in their :ref:`Bestiary entry <bestiary.kobold>`\ .

New Rules
##########

Kobolds use a wide variety of tricks and techniques to repel invaders. Below are some new rules displaying the height of kobold defensive tactics and technology.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#kobold_archetypes`:

Kobold Archetypes
******************

The following archetypes are available to kobolds.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#alchemical_trapper`: `monstercodex.kobolds#alchemical_trapper_(alchemist)`_

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#alchemical_trapper_(alchemist)`:

Alchemical Trapper (Alchemist)
===============================

Because kobolds rely on traps to soften up enemies, kobold alchemists learn to turn bombs into traps. When such alchemists are preparing defenses against larger creatures that might enter their tunnels and attempt to exterminate them, their skills mean the difference between life and death.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#bomb_trap`:

\ **Bomb Trap (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, an alchemical trapper can use one of her bombs to make a trap. Setting a bomb trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A bomb trap fills a single 5-foot square and cannot be placed in the same area as any other trap. The alchemical trapper needs the same materials required for making a bomb. The DCs for :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks to notice the trap, :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to the DC for the alchemical trapper's bombs. All bomb traps have location triggers and do not reset. The alchemical trapper can use any one discovery that applies to a bomb when making a bomb trap. The bomb trap lasts 10 minutes for each alchemist level the trapper possesses. If the bomb trap is not disabled or exploded within that time frame, the trap becomes inert. Creating a bomb trap uses one of the alchemical trapper's bombs per day. This ability replaces the discovery at 2nd level.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#trapfinding`:

\ **Trapfinding (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, an alchemical trapper can find and disable traps, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability replaces the discovery at 4th level.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#dragon_yapper`: `monstercodex.kobolds#dragon_yapper_(bard)`_

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#dragon_yapper_(bard)`:

Dragon Yapper (Bard)
=====================

Kobolds' yammering songs distract opponents in combat, hindering their ability to attack.

\ **Bardic Performance**\ : A dragon yapper gains the following types of bardic performance.

\ *Yapping Song (Su)*\  : A dragon yapper can use performance to annoy those that hear it, causing them to take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a –1 penalty on saves against fear effects and charm effects as long as the dragon yapper continues performing. This penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. Yapping song is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible components, but is not language-dependent. This performance replaces fascinate.

\ *Frightful Song (Su)*\  : A dragon yapper of 8th level or higher can amplify his voice to sound like an actual dragon. Enemies within 30 feet become shaken unless they succeed at a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 the dragon yapper's level + the dragon yapper's Charisma modifier). A successful save renders targets immune to this ability for 24 hours. Frightful song is a mind-affecting ability, and a fear effect that uses audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.

\ *Versatile Performance (Ex)*\  : A dragon yapper must choose sing at 2nd level.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#kobold_companions`:

Kobold Companions
******************

Each of these animal companions has a different starting speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. As you gain levels, your companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by other animal companions . Each companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each choice. A kobold cavalier can select either of these companions as a mount instead of a dog or pony.

Kobold priests are charged with ensuring both the spiritual and the physical welfare of a kobold tribe. These devilspeakers believe a tribe should work like a well-oiled machine, and while kobolds' natural cowardice sometimes gets in the way, devilspeakers keep their warriors fighting bravely—whether the troops like it or not. Devilspeakers keep spells like :ref:`animate dead <corerulebook.spells.animatedead#animate_dead>`\  handy, turning fallen kobold warriors into zombies. These kobold zombies effectively soften up invading adventurers, and dig tirelessly in the mines.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Fiery Regeneration (Su)**\  A kyrana does not take damage from fire-based attacks. Additionally, when a kyrana would normally take fire damage, it heals that number of hit points, to a maximum of 5 hit points per round. A kyrana can't use its breath weapon to heal itself.

Kyranas are large, iguana-like relatives of true dragons, with low intelligence and an affinity for fire. Though quite weak as dragons go, kyranas are still dangerous enough to command the fear and respect of kobolds, who often encounter the fire-breathing dragons while digging deep tunnels.

Kyranas are primarily subterranean creatures, though they can occasionally be found on the surface in extremely hot or volcanic areas. Healed supernaturally by contact with fire, they often spend their time swimming in volcanic calderas or underground lava lakes, taking in geothermic energy and storing it in order to release it on their prey as lines of fiery breath.

If kyranas stayed confined to their magma homes, they would present little problem to other races. Unfortunately, they're extremely territorial, even toward their own offspring. Kyranas are born in clutches of six to 12 eggs, and raised by both parents. As soon as the creatures reach adulthood at the age of 18 months, however, the parents turn on their offspring and drive them from the nest. The exiled kyranas then split up and wander the surrounding tunnels, traveling hundreds of miles in search of any source of heat. That means they often come waddling into inhabited areas, snorting and ready to burn anyone standing between them and the hearth. Adventurers may find their campfires claimed by a greedy kyrana, or end up being followed for their torchlight. Kobolds often use these barely intelligent dragons as heavy artillery, employing fire arrows and flaming traps to lure them into conflict with enemies.

An adult kyrana is 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds on average.

Kobold Encounters
##################

Kobolds rarely march out with large bands of warriors, preferring small bands with diverse talents and many tricks up their sleeves. The following are some examples of kobold encounters.

.. _`monstercodex.kobolds#miners_(cr_2)`:

Miners (CR 2)
**************

When a group of kobolds digs its way into a dwarven cavern or a gnomish village or a human dungeon, the group typically consists of miners and a sniper. Should the group encounter resistance, the miners hold off the attackers while the sniper gives what support it can before retreating to warn the tribe.

Scouting Party (CR 5)
**********************

When kobolds discover a new tunnel (or dig into a castle dungeon), they send in a scouting party to test its stability. A pair of bombers set bombs, while a spellcaster or cultist compels the lower-ranked kobolds to set them off.

Kobold Defenders (CR 11)
*************************

Kobolds prefer to let their slaves and traps do the fighting. If enemies do break through into the heart of a tribe's lair, even the chief fights to defend the eggs and protect the next generation of kobolds, and other kobolds find themselves fighting more fiercely in his presence.
