Special Abilities
==================

\ **Droning Wings (Ex)**\ Once per day, when it flutters its wings as a standard action, a coloxus can create a mesmerizing display of color and a sound-dampening buzzing drone. All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a DC 24 Will save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round, the coloxus must take a swift action to maintain the effect or the effect ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer against sonic energy, granting the fly :ref:`demon <bestiary.creaturetypes#demon_subtype>`\  :ref:`immunity <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#immunity_(ex_or_su)>`\  to sonic attacks or effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

\ **Siphon (Su)**\ Any creature bitten by a coloxus must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A coloxus heals itself of 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble humans with the head of a fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. A coloxus prefers to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility of any race. A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.

Ironically—given their grotesque, insectile appearance—coloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption.

Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand.

Evil mortal spellcasters are  fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a reflection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors—any creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Pain Redoubled (Su)**\  When an incubus confirms a critical hit with a melee weapon or a natural weapon, that attack deals an additional 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be wracked by pain, becoming sickened for 1d6 rounds. Multiple uses of this ability extend the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.

An incubus in his true form is always muscular and attractive, with long hair and intense eyes. His skin can be of any color, but is always smooth and silky. When not using his wings for flight, an incubus can fold them to drape across its shoulders like a cloak—many decorate both the inside and outside of their wings with tattoos, ink, or self-inflicted scars. Incubi stand between 6 and 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh 200 pounds.

When not in battle, incubi serve as counselors, torturers, and companions for greater demons. They are also often conjured for similar roles by mortal spellcasters, although care must be taken in dalliances with incubi, for they delight in causing pain to their companions.

Like succubi, incubi form from the chaotic evil souls of particularly lustful and rapacious mortals. Yet whereas succubi are subtle and methodical about using their charms to cause ruin, the typical incubus is forthright and forceful about his insatiable desires.

\ **Treasure**\  standard (masterwork halberd, other treasure)

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Disease (Ex)**\  A schir gnaws constantly at the ends of its halberd. This infuses the blades with disease from the :ref:`demon <bestiary.creaturetypes#demon_subtype>`\ 's filthy spittle. Any creature struck by a schir's halberd must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or contract gray pox—a frightening disease that causes weakness, gray splotches on the skin, and eventual catatonia. The save DC is Constitution-based.

 \ *Gray Pox*\ : Halberd—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 15; \ *onset*\  1 day; \ *frequency*\  1/day; \ *effect*\  1d6 Str damage; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.

A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a demonic goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds. 

Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes—acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders.

Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times.

A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army—often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating gnoll tribes.
