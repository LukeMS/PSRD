Special Abilities
==================

\ **Baleful Shriek (Su)**\  Once every 1d4 rounds, a revenant can shriek as a standard action. All creatures within a 60-foot spread must make a DC 18 Will save or cower in :ref:`fear <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#fear_(su_or_sp)>`\  for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting :ref:`fear <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#fear_(su_or_sp)>`\  effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Reason to Hate (Su)**\  A revenant's existence is fueled by its hatred for its murderer. As long as the murderer exists, the revenant exists. If the murderer dies, the revenant is immediately slain. A murderer who becomes :ref:`undead <bestiary.creaturetypes#undead>`\  does not trigger a revenant's destruction. When a revenant encounters its murderer, it gains the benefits of a :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\  spell (CL 20th) that lasts as long as its murderer remains in sight. Against its murderer, the revenant also gains a +4 profane bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, grapple checks, and saving throws.

\ **Self-Loathing (Ex)**\ When confronted with its reflection or any object that was important to it in life, a revenant must make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with self-pity. This condition renders the revenant helpless, and lasts until the revenant is attacked or sees its murderer. If a revenant resists becoming overwhelmed, the revenant becomes obsessed with the source that triggered the saving throw and does everything it can to destroy it, reacting to the trigger as if the trigger were its murderer and gaining bonuses from its reason to hate ability.

\ **Sense Murderer (Su)**\  A revenant knows the direction but not the distance to its murderer—this sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. Against its murderer, a revenant has :ref:`true seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\  and :ref:`discern lies <corerulebook.spells.discernlies#discern_lies>`\  in effect at all times (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.

Fueled by hatred and a need for vengeance, a revenant rises from the grave to hunt and kill its murderer. Devoid of any compassion, emotion, or logic, a revenant has but one purpose, and cannot rest until it has found vengeance.
