Mind Blank
===========

\ **School**\ abjuration; \ **Level**\ sorcerer/wizard 8

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 standard action

\ **Components**\ V, S

\ **Range**\ close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\ one creature

\ **Duration**\ 24 hours

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as :ref:`detect evil <corerulebook.spells.detectevil#detect_evil>`\ , :ref:`locate creature <corerulebook.spells.locatecreature#locate_creature>`\ , scry, and\ *see invisible*\ ). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. \ *Mind blank*\ even foils :ref:`limited wish <corerulebook.spells.limitedwish#limited_wish>`\ , :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\ , and :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as :ref:`arcane eye <corerulebook.spells.arcaneeye#arcane_eye>`\ , the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
