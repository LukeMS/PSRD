\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  living creature touched

\ *Magic fang*\ gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.

Magic Fang, Greater
====================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  druid 3, ranger 3

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one living creature

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level

This spell functions like :ref:`magic fang <corerulebook.spells.magicfang#magic_fang>`\ , except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass :ref:`damage reduction <corerulebook.glossary#damage_reduction>`\  aside from magic.

Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).

\ *Greater magic fang*\ can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell.
