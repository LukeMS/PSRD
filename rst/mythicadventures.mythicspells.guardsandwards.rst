Guards and Wards
=================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`guards and wards <corerulebook.spells.guardsandwards#guards_and_wards>`

You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area as if by a mental :ref:`alarm <corerulebook.spells.alarm#alarm>`\  spell as long as you're on the same plane as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the warded area as if using :ref:`arcane eye <corerulebook.spells.arcaneeye#arcane_eye>`\ . When you start concentrating, the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell (:ref:`dancing lights <corerulebook.spells.dancinglights#dancing_lights>`\  and so on) instead of one.

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : You can place the following effects anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional use of mythic power per effect.

6. :ref:`Black tentacles <corerulebook.spells.blacktentacles#black_tentacles>`\  in one place, returning after 10 minutes if dispelled.

7. :ref:`Dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  in one place. You select an area up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area is targeted by the spell. \ *Saving Throw*\ : Will negates. Spell :ref:`Resistance <corerulebook.spells.resistance#resistance>`\ : yes.

8. :ref:`Entangle <corerulebook.spells.entangle#entangle>`\  in four places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.

9. :ref:`Explosive runes <corerulebook.spells.explosiverunes#explosive_runes>`\  in three places, returning in 10 minutes if activated or dispelled.

10. :ref:`Slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  in three places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.
