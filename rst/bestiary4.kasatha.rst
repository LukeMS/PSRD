Special Abilities
==================

\ **Desert Runner (Ex)**\  A kasatha has a +4 racial bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves to avoid fatigue, exhaustion, and other ill effects from running, forced marches, starvation, thirst, and hot or cold environments.

\ **Desert Stride (Ex)**\  A kasatha moves through nonmagical difficult terrain in desert environments at normal speed.

\ **Jumper (Ex)**\  A kasatha is always considered to have a running start when attempting :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  checks to jump.

\ **Multi-Armed (Ex)**\  A kasatha has four arms. One hand is considered its primary hand; all others are considered off hands. It can use any of its hands for other purposes that require free hands.

\ **Stalker (Ex)**\  :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  and :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  are class skills for a kasatha.

Exiles from an arid world circling a red star, modern kasathas have no idea how they left their home or how to return, but they keep searching for a way back. A clannish and secretive people, they have a matriarchal society, but other races have difficulty recognizing any physical difference between females and males. Kasathas keep their mouths hidden behind clothing, and don't remove this clothing in the presence of other races. They are omnivores, but prefer meat and salty foods.

Upon reaching adulthood, many kasathas leave their clans to search the world for adventure, treasure, and ways to return to their homeworld.
