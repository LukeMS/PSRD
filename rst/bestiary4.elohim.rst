.. _`bestiary4.elohim#special_abilities`:

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Create Life (Su)**\  At will, an elohim can create any one plant or living creature. A creature created can have no more than 4 Hit Dice and be no larger than Large size, and is not under the elohim's control.

\ **Natural Spellcasting (Su)**\  An elohim can cast spells in any shape, similar to the Natural Spell feat.

An elohim is a strange being obsessed with creating miniature worlds populated with creatures of its choosing. It creates new permanent demiplanes or alters remote environments in pre-existing planes, seeds them with new life, then eventually abandons them. An elohim might return to its creation decades or centuries later to observe how its progeny have fared, and might allow them to continue or eradicate them completely. Elohim communicate with other beings only rarely, and always in a cryptic fashion.
