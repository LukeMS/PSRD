:ref:`Brand <advancedplayersguide.spells.brand#brand>`\  etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6 characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. A :ref:`brand <advancedplayersguide.spells.brand#brand>`\  can be hidden by clothing or removed by scraping it away (causing 1d6 points of damage), though the :ref:`brand <advancedplayersguide.spells.brand#brand>`\  returns if the damage is healed.

Brand, Greater

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  inquisitor 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 round

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  permanent

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

This spell functions like :ref:`brand <advancedplayersguide.spells.brand#brand>`\ , except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a :ref:`greater brand <advancedplayersguide.spells.brand#brand_greater>`\  blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects of :ref:`bestow curse <corerulebook.spells.bestowcurse#bestow_curse>`\ , a :ref:`greater brand <advancedplayersguide.spells.brand#brand_greater>`\  cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a :ref:`mark of justice <corerulebook.spells.markofjustice#mark_of_justice>`\ .
