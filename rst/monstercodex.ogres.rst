Ogres
******

Few adventurers are prepared for the fetid odors, blundering stupidity, and barbaric depravity that characterize an encounter with ogres. An ogre makes a dramatic first impression with its intimidating size; at 9 to 10 feet tall, ogres tower over most humanoids, and their hideously thick arms and legs bulge with massive, misshapen muscles.

Ogres are the crudest and most populous of giants, but generations of rampant inbreeding and crossbreeding have turned them into a mockery of giantkind. As such, the other giant races detest ogres and treat these weaker cousins with derisive scorn. But with their insular families and sociopathic tendencies, ogres care little about these opinions, and an ogre clan is just as likely to prey on a lone giant as on any other creature.

Ogres are twisted beasts that suffer from physical defects and mutations at a dramatically higher rate than any other race, due to their habit of inbreeding as a method of cementing familial bonds. The resulting defects don't bother the ogres, who view their deformities as the mark of whatever dark god they worship. This same superstition leads ogres to despise beautiful creatures; when given the opportunity, they go out of their way to mutilate and torture the most attractive of their victims.

In addition to being the most numerous of giants, ogres are the widest ranging, and they are encountered in nearly every sort of terrain. There are brown-skinned ogres wandering desert regions; pale-skinned, shaggy beasts roaming the arctic lands; and numerous clans inhabiting forests, swamps, and vast open plains.

Ogres normally form family groups consisting of half a dozen to a dozen adults and juveniles, led exclusively by a powerful patriarch or matriarch known as the "boss." Larger families have been known to exist, but ogres are so destructive that few areas can support a clan with more than a dozen members, and these groups usually break up because of hunger and infighting. The boss's power is absolute within the ogre clan, and the only law is that which she enforces. Favored members get the choicest morsels at meals and the best bedding, while those who have fallen out of favor go hungry and are singled out for harsh beatings and repeated abuse. In spite of this, ogre clans are fairly tightly knit.

Food and survival are both continual problems for ogre families. These large brutes require tremendous amounts of meat to survive, but have little patience for mundane tasks such as agriculture or animal husbandry, so they fill their larders by pillaging, robbing, and killing. Ogres aren't entirely reliant on murder; some also act as hunters and trappers. In lean times, ogres possess no reservations about cannibalism. The sick or infirm don't survive long during famine, and any perceived rival might be quietly killed to fill the stewpot and eliminate dissent. Even a family member that's healthy and in good standing might end up on the dinner plate if the boss goes hungry for too long.

Ogres hunt either by running creatures to exhaustion or by forming a big circle and driving prey into the center to be slaughtered. A small ogre hunting party might follow a herd of deer for days, picking off stragglers and bagging them for future consumption. Ogres use variations on these techniques to hunt humans and other intelligent prey. The actual hunt can provide more pleasure to the ogres than the eventual slaughter, as they delight in the fear and desperation of their prey. This has the unfortunate side effect of making many of their hunts extravagantly wasteful. Ogres also find gratification in pure torture, but their skill is limited by impatience and a poor understanding of the limits of humanoid physiology. These ham-fisted brutes' torture sessions usually end all too quickly, from the ogres' perspective—but as an early end hastens mealtime, most ogres have no regrets.

Ogres see smaller creatures as prey and stay their hand only if they feel that they wouldn't win in a fight or if they can be convinced there is a greater reward to be had by parleying. Adventurers tell stories of tricking ogres into releasing them with promises of secret treasures, and a few audacious humans have even had luck partnering with ogres. Eventually, though, most would-be schemers discover that the ogre's appetite overrules any thought of camaraderie or future reward.

Even the most foolish ogre families learn caution when in close proximity to populous human settlements. Ogres know humans band together when threatened, so clans most often prey on the fringes of society, concentrating attacks on small villages, poorly armed caravans, or isolated farmsteads. They tend to avoid elven lands, as elves kill any ogres who dare to enter their forests, and ogres have little interest in digging dwarves out of their warrens. Ogres view smaller humanoids like gnomes and halflings as the tastiest of the man-like creatures and often pursue tiny prey with rapt fascination, but it never occurs to them that such diminutive creatures might be cleverer than they are. There are many tales of halflings and gnomes defeating the large, foolish giants through guile.

Ogres have been incorporated into large armies on past occasions, but usually only when another creature has recruited them with promises of food and keeps them in line with harsh punishments. Under the flag of a powerful giant (or even human) general, a well-equipped ogre regiment forms a devastating horde. Ogres' strength and dim-witted fearlessness make them excellent shock troops. Still, such commanders quickly learn to not send these brutish and impulsive giants against cities that they wish to capture with minimal damage to the structures and residents.

Full statistics for ogres can be found in their :ref:`Bestiary entry <bestiary.ogre>`\ .

New Rules
##########

Ogres are known for their stupidity, violence, and filthy habits; their talents lie not in innovation or research, but in perversion, strength, and survival. As a result, the new ogre options presented here emphasize the race's degenerate ancestry, odd mutations, and ability to adapt to new environments.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#ogre_simple_templates`:

Ogre Simple Templates
**********************

Whether it's due to inbreeding, magical or alchemical experimentation, or strange environs, ogres are far more prone to mutations than other races. Ogres can survive with defects that would outright kill members of most other species. Below is a small sample of mutations that might be seen among ogres in a clan.

Ogre Giantkin Template
***********************

Ogres sometimes interbreed with other giants. The result of such crossbreeding is a giantkin ogre, which gains some abilities from its non-ogre parents. In areas where ogre clans live near large populations of giants, interbreeding can be so common that entire ogre clans consist solely of giantkin.

Ogre Feats
***********

The following feats are available to ogres.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#corrupted_flesh`:

Corrupted Flesh
================

You have sickened, rotting flesh from some deformity or vestigial limb that has turned fetid and necrotic, yet refuses to heal or fall off.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Con 15, 6 HD, ogre.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain the stench special ability (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Constitution modifier).

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#fetid_breath`:

Fetid Breath
=============

The rotting of your flesh has spread to your lungs and fills them with putrid fluids.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Con 15, Corrupted Flesh, 6 HD, ogre.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can exhale a 30-foot cone of vile-smelling, moist air mixed with phlegm and remnants of old meals. Creatures in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) or they are nauseated for 1d6 minutes. Affected creatures that spend a full-round action gasping for fresh air and scraping off your oral debris may attempt another save to overcome the effect. You can use this breath weapon twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every 6 HD you possess beyond 6.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#gluttonous_gobbler`:

Gluttonous Gobbler
===================

Some ogres are able to quickly choke down even the largest of meals so they can get on with other business.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Both :ref:`Improved Unarmed Strike <corerulebook.feats#improved_unarmed_strike>`\  and :ref:`Improved Grapple <corerulebook.feats#improved_grapple>`\  or the grab ability, ogre, size Large or larger.

\ **Benefit**\ : If you start your turn grappling another creature at least two size categories smaller than you, you can put the grappled creature in your mouth as a move action and attempt another grapple combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If you succeed, you swallow the opponent as if you had the swallow whole special ability.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#night_stalker`:

Night Stalker
==============

You excel at hunting humans in the dead of night and murdering them quietly.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Skill Focus <corerulebook.feats#skill_focus>`\  (:ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\ ), darkvision, half-ogre or ogre, size Large or larger.

\ **Benefit**\ : While in areas of dim lighting or natural darkness, you ignore all size penalties on :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks and gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against flat-footed enemies.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#ogre_crush`:

Ogre Crush
===========

Your thick, muscular arms are capable of landing powerful blows and crushing the life out of the smaller creatures you embrace.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Str 25, :ref:`Improved Grapple <corerulebook.feats#improved_grapple>`\ , :ref:`Improved Unarmed Strike <corerulebook.feats#improved_unarmed_strike>`\ , ogre, size Large or larger.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step when you're grappling creatures smaller than you. You gain the constrict monster special ability, dealing an amount of damage equal to either the slam damage for a creature of your size or your unarmed strike damage, whichever is greater.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#raging_brute`:

Raging Brute
=============

You are able to harness the rage that burns inside you and fuels your might.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Str 21, ogre.

\ **Benefit**\ : Select one rage power. Once per day as a free action, you can enter a state of fury and gain the effects of this rage power for 1 minute. If the rage power normally ends a barbarian rage when used, the ability ends after it's used and you immediately become fatigued. You don't otherwise become fatigued at the end of this ability's duration.

Your effective barbarian level for the purpose of qualifying for and using rage powers is equal to your total Hit Dice – 3. This feat doesn't grant any of the normal benefits or penalties of a barbarian's rage.

\ **Special**\ : You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose another rage power and gain one additional use per day of this feat. Each time you activate this feat, you can use any or all of your rage powers gained from this feat.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#savage_critical`:

Savage Critical
================

You are able to land critical hits precisely, dealing devastating damage.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Str 19, ogre, sneak attack +2d6.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you hit a creature using the :ref:`Vital Strike <corerulebook.feats#vital_strike>`\  feat or confirm a critical hit against an opponent, add your sneak attack damage to the damage from the attack. This feat has no effect on attacks that already allow you to add sneak attack damage.

.. _`monstercodex.ogres#vestigial_head`:

Vestigial Head
===============

You were born with a parasitic vestigial head with its own stunted brain. The head may be mostly subsumed within your own flesh and visible only as a distorted face, or it might sprout out of its own neck from your neck, shoulder, back, or chest.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Ogre.

\ **Benefit**\ : Anytime you must attempt a Will save against a hostile effect, there is a 25% change that the effect targets your vestigial head instead. If this occurs, you are treated as if you had succeeded at your saving throw, and instead are sickened for 1d4 rounds or the duration of the effect (whichever is longer).

\ **Special**\ : You can take this feat twice. The second time you do, the chance of a hostile Will effect targeting your vestigial head instead of your own increases to 50%. This doesn't give you another vestigial head.

A common practice among depraved ogre hunters who catch humanoid prey is to sever the victim's hand, foot, or entire limb, cauterize the wound, and then force the creature to watch while the ogre or his hungry wolf companion devours the amputated body part; when the captive has no limbs left, it's kicked around like a toy and finally roasted on a spit.

These dim-witted creatures are a mongrel cross between a troll and an ogre, combining the worst features of each. They usually act like animals and move on all fours, but can rear up on their hind legs to attack with their sharp claws and vicious bites. Some ogres keep them as pets, treating them as exceptionally stupid but hilarious kinfolk. Trolls usually kill troggles on sight, and have been known to band together to wipe out entire ogre clans that possess troggles.

Ogre Encounters
################

Ogres are prolific and can be found in nearly any environment in search of food, fun distractions, or a place to settle down for awhile—much to the dismay of neighboring races.

Dark Celebration (CR 7)
************************

This encounter could be a priestess and a small group of followers could be on a pilgrimage, or a small family group led by an ogre cleric, following a vision.

Hunting Party (CR 10)
**********************

These savagely efficient teams stalk and kill both animals and two-legged prey. Adventurers are likely to encounter them taking down a large prey animal, preying on a small village to capture humans, or tearing apart a poorly defended caravan.

Village Eaters (CR 11)
***********************

When times are lean, multiple ogre clans gather together to utterly destroy a village—or even a small town. The villagers and their livestock fill the larders of these impromptu armies, which often devolve into internal conflict over the spoils.
