Mislead
========

\ **Source**\  :ref:`mislead <corerulebook.spells.mislead#mislead>`

You create one illusory double per 5 caster levels, each of which appears in your square or in an unoccupied square adjacent to yours. When you cast the spell, you can give each of these doubles a simple programmed task as a telepathic command, such a "walk south," "beg for mercy," or "follow that troll."

You can change or modify a single illusory double's programmed task by spending a swift, move, or standard action; this requires concentration.

\ **Augmented (4th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, this spell also grants you the benefits of augmented :ref:`mythic invisibility <mythicadventures.mythicspells.invisibility>`\  instead of :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`\ .
