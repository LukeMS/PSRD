Special Abilities
==================

\ **Constructed (Ex)**\  For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count both as humanoids and as constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects. They are not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep effects.

\ **Emotionless**\  Androids can never gain morale bonuses and are immune to fear effects and emotion effects. They have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks.

\ **Nanite Surge (Ex)**\  An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting her a bonus equal to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent to that of a torch for 1 round.

The technological beings known as androids possess an almost human appearance. Although they are not human, most androids who dwell among humans prefer to hide their true nature and attempt to live as if they were humans. Their difficulty in understanding and imitating emotions can betray their true nature if they are not careful, so most study humans intently to become better at disguising themselves. Androids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The alien forges in which new androids are created are hidden in mysterious ruins, and most androids have no memory of the processes involved in their creation or the locations where their construction took place.

A typical android stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.

\ **Exceptional Senses (Ex)**\ : Androids have darkvision to a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.

\ **Constructed (Ex)**\ : See the stat block above.

\ **Emotionless**\ : See the stat block above.

\ **Nanite Surge (Ex)**\ : See the stat block above.

\ **Languages:**\  Androids begin play speaking Common. Androids with high Intelligence can choose any language as a bonus language (except secret languages, such as Druidic).
