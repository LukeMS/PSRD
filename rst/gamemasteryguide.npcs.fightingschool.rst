Fighting School
################
Favoring students with strong arms and disciplined souls, fighting schools pass on secrets of martial finesse to those with the talent and ability to be trained. Whether taking the form of monasteries hidden high in misty mountains or underground fighting pits secreted beneath city streets, fighting schools hone their students into living weapons. While many fighting schools focus on exotic martial arts, some students learn their skills from the brutality of the streets, the ways of beasts, or the techniques of long-dead warrior sages.

\ **Boon**\  Initiates can assist the PCs in a single fight or offer the PCs free temporary lodging at their academy.
Initiates are the novice members of martial arts academies or monasteries, learning hand-to-hand fighting, agility, meditation, and humility at the hands of their masters. They may spend their entire lives in the monastery, honing their minds and bodies to perfection.
Initiates can serve as bodyguards in areas where weapons are forbidden or as unconventional foot soldiers and skirmishers. They could also be used as unarmed brawlers, boxers, gladiators, or pit fighters.
Exchanging an initiate's monk bonus feats creates NPCs with different combat abilities, such as :ref:`Catch Off-Guard <corerulebook.feats#catch_off_guard>`\  and :ref:`Throw Anything <corerulebook.feats#throw_anything>`\  for an improvised weapon master, :ref:`Improved Grapple <corerulebook.feats#improved_grapple>`\  for a wrestler, or :ref:`Scorpion Style <corerulebook.feats#scorpion_style>`\  for different unarmed combat flavor.
An initiate may be found escorting a pair of acolytes (CR 3), or four initiates could be responsible for protecting a group of six pilgrims on a pilgrimage to a distant temple (CR 9). A group of six initiates might be encountered traveling between two monasteries (CR 6), or five initiates could form a training class under the tutelage of a battle monk (CR 7).

\ **Boon**\  A battle monk can assist the PCs in a single fight (or send several initiates) if it serves the interest of her academy or her master. A battle monk could also introduce the PCs to the master of her academy or to a diplomat, merchant, or other NPC from the land where her martial art originated.
Battle monks are the instructors in fighting schools and monasteries, teaching the arts of agility and swift perfection to their students. They are also the honor guard for their masters, the messengers and emissaries of the school and its methods. 
Battle monks make excellent thief-takers and mid-level bounty hunters, catching and disabling their quarry and bring them back for questioning. A battle monk can also serve as an unarmed, but still dangerous and effective, bodyguard.
A battle monk often has a trio of initiates with her (CR 6), or two battle monks might accompany a holy warrior affiliated with the school (CR 8).
