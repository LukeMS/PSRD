Special Abilities
==================

\ **Cytillesh Flash (Su)**\  Once per day, a cytillipede can cause the cytillesh patches that grow along its body to release a bright flash of blue light that provides bright light in a 20-foot radius and raises the light level by one step for the next 20 feet (treat this ability as a 4th-level light spell). Creatures within the 40-foot area of effect must succeed at a DC 22 Will save. Those within the 20-foot area of bright light that fail are stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures within the next 20 feet that fail are instead confused for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  Biteâ€”injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 20; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d3 Dex, dazed, and the effects of :ref:`memory lapse <advancedplayersguide.spells.memorylapse#memory_lapse>`\ ; \ *cure*\  1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Derros have long used other creatures in their experiments with alchemical and magical augmentation. For the most part, these experiments don't have the results the derros had in mind, and can be considered qualified successes at best. However, on rare occasions derros actually get it right and come up with a powerful and obedient creature they can train and use.

The cytillipede arose from one of those rare triumphs. Derro alchemists adapted the diet of a species of albino centipede to eat nothing but cytillesh fungus. After these centipedes had endured years of exposure to the fungus and certain magical augmentations, the result was an entirely new species that the derros named the cytillipede.

A cytillipede has a gray segmented body covered in chitin. Patches of cytillesh fungus grow along its back, giving the creature an eerie blue glow. Because of its constant radiance, a cytillipede in the open is fairly easy to spot. Most of the time, a cytillipede is encountered in the company of derros, who use their creations as mounts or to guard their lairs.

In combat, a cytillipede simply rushes at its opponent and makes bite attacks, relying on its cytillesh venom to stun its enemies so it can bite them repeatedly while they deal with the disorientation of sudden short-term memory loss. A cytillipede normally uses its cytillesh flash ability only when it has been seriously wounded or threatened by multiple opponents. A trained cytillipede can also be commanded to use this ability by its rider. Because of their long exposure to cytillesh, derros are unaffected by the cytillesh-based attacks of cytillipedes, and delight in directing them against their foes.

Cytillipedes are most often encountered as part of a derro patrol around a derro lair, usually as mounts. A typical cytillipede is a little over 10 feet long and 3-1/2 feet high, and weighs about 600 pounds.
