Special Abilities
==================

\ **Deep Dweller (Ex)**\  Deep ones are immune to damage from water pressure; their bodies are capable of instantly adjusting to different water depths or even the surface with ease.

\ **Devoted (Ex)**\  Deep ones are fanatically religious, be it to the worship of a Great Old One, an elder deep one, or some other divinity. A deep one gains one bonus skill rank per Hit Die that must be placed in Knowledge (religion), and this skill is a class skill for all deep ones.

\ **Immortal (Ex)**\  A deep one does not age. Barring death from violence, disease, or misadventure, a deep one can live forever. Deep ones are immune to effects that cause magical aging.

\ **Item Use (Su)**\  A deep one can activate spell-trigger items like staves and wands as if it were a spellcaster of the appropriate class.

Deep ones are as at ease dwelling in the most remote of ocean trenches as they are in the shallows that hug secluded shorelines, although their favorite haunts combine the two. The largest deep one cities are located at places not far off shore, but nestled in vast submerged canyons unusually close to those coastlines. This proximity allows deep ones to pursue one of their favorite goals—commingling with and corrupting surface-dwelling humanoids. Unlike skum, a similar aquatic race that reproduces with surface dwellers, deep ones do so not out of a biological need but as a way to spread their blasphemous religion above the ocean waves. The hybrid children of deep ones and humans form :ref:`a race of their own <bestiary5.deepones#deep_one_hybrid>`\ . These offspring typically live near others of their kind, assuming positions of leadership in their small towns.

Deep ones usually worship the alien entities known as the Outer Gods or the Great Old Ones, with Cthulhu the foremost among them. Deep one settlements that contain a deep one elder (see page 69) instead typically venerate that powerful deep one, who in turn serves one of the eldritch gods. Many deep ones gain levels as clerics, inciting religious fervor in their kinfolk and promoting their chosen deities as the greatest among the Outer Gods. Those few who instead choose to take up a less focused devotional path, such as that of an oracle, still venerate the Old Ones as a whole.

Deep ones prefer to fight with their claws. If they do resort to manufactured weapons, they prefer piercing ones, as these function best underwater. They can also use wands and staves; deep ones who pursue the study of more powerful magic often learn to create magic items for their weaker kinfolk to wield.

A deep one typically stands about 7 feet tall, but its hunched gait and lumbering stance can make it appear shorter when it shambles ashore. An average deep one weighs 300 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Deep Dweller (Ex)**\  See page 68.

:ref:`Devastating Strike <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#devastating_strike>`\  (Ex) An elder deep one ignores the first 10 points of hardness when it damages an object with its claws. A creature struck with a critical hit from an elder deep one's claw must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.

\ **Deific**\  An elder deep one can grant divine spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the elder deep one's behalf. Elder deep ones grant access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Water. Their symbols vary, but their favored weapon is the claw.

\ **Immortal (Ex)**\  See page 68.

\ **Item Use (Su)**\  See page 68.

\ **Mind Reflection (Ex)**\  Any mind-affecting effect that fails to affect an elder deep one is reflected back on the source, affecting the original caster as if by :ref:`spell turning <corerulebook.spells.spellturning#spell_turning>`\ , treating the elder deep one as the controller and source of the spell.

\ **Staggering Presence (Ex)**\  This ability functions as frightful presence, except that a creature that fails its save is also staggered as long as it remains in the area of effect, and for an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving that area. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

A few deep ones never stop growing over the eons of their endless lives. Many elder deep ones claim the names of monsters or gods for their own—Mother Hydra and Father Dagon being two of the more legendary of their kind. Elder deep ones ascend to the status of near-gods in deep one society, towering over their kin and ruling their sunken cities. Just as they are worshiped, so do the elder deep ones worship the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods themselves.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Final Change (Su)**\  A deep one hybrid ages at the same rate as a half-orc. A mere 1d12 months after a deep one hybrid reaches venerable age (at 60 years old), it dies a painful, agonizing death, only to have its body transform into that of a mature deep one. This transformation functions as the :ref:`reincarnate <corerulebook.spells.reincarnate#reincarnate>`\  spell, with the newly formed deep one gaining the following modifications to its physical ability scores: +6 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6 Constitution.

\ **Sea Longing (Ex)**\  Every 24 hours a deep one hybrid spends in an area more than 10 miles from the sea, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1 point of Wisdom drain.

\ **Take to the Water (Ex)**\  A deep one hybrid can hold its breath 10 times longer than a human can, and gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks and Reflex saving throws while swimming. A deep one hybrid has a swim speed of 30 feet, and gains a +8 racial bonus on all Swim checks.

Deep one hybrids are the spawn of humans and deep ones. They are most comfortable with others of their kind, and typically cluster in small, insular settlements where they can assume positions of authority. They keep any humans within their towns subservient and cowed, making sure those other residents know better than to act against local laws. Though deep ones are devoutly religious, they usually cloak their true beliefs under a facade of more conventional worship, believing that by doing so they can avoid suspicion from visitors and nearby societies.
