Persistent Vigor
=================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  alchemist 4, cleric 4, inquisitor 4, shaman 4, witch 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (ginseng root shavings)

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

You are filled with a persistent vigor. You gain fast healing 2 and are immune to bleed effects as well as the sickened and nauseated conditions. When you succeed at a saving throw against a disease or poison effect, that disease or poison effect ends (as if you had succeeded at enough saving throws to cure that effect).

If you fail a saving throw against a disease or poison effect, you can instantly dismiss this spell to reroll that saving throw with a +4 bonus; you must take the result of this reroll, even if it is lower.
