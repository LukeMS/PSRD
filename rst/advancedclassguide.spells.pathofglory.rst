Path of Glory
==============

\ **School**\  conjuration (healing); \ **Level**\  bard 2, cleric 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch (see text)

\ **Area**\  four 5-ft. squares/level (see text)

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You cause four 5-foot squares (one of which must be your space) to glow with dim illumination. Starting on your next turn, as a swift action you can extend the glowing area by an additional four 5-foot squares; each new square must be adjacent to a square that was previously glowing. Allies who end their turns on a glowing square (including those who fall unconscious in the square) are healed of 1 point of damage.
