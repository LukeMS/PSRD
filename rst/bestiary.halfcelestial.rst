Creating a Half-Celestial
**************************

"Half-celestial" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more. A half-celestial creature retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

\ **CR**\ : HD 5 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 6–10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.

\ **Alignment**\ : Any good.

\ **Type**\ : The creature's type changes to :ref:`outsider <bestiary.creaturetypes#outsider>`\  (:ref:`native <bestiary.creaturetypes#native_subtype>`\ ). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

\ **Armor Class**\ : Natural armor improves by +1.

\ **Defenses/Qualities**\ : It gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to disease; +4 racial bonus on saves vs. poison; acid, cold, and electricity resist 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to CR + 11 (maximum 35).

\ **Speed**\ : Unless the base creature flies better, the half-celestial flies at twice the base creature's land speed (good maneuverability).

\ **Special Abilities**\ : A half-celestial gains the following.

\ *Smite Evil (Su)*\ : Once per day, as a swift action, the half-celestial can smite evil as a paladin of the same level as its Hit Dice. The smite persists until the target is dead or the half-celestial rests.

\ *Spell-Like Abilities*\ : A half-celestial with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals the creature's HD (or the caster evel of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).
