Werebats are hybrids of vampiric bats and humanoids, possessed of a ravenous bloodlust. As opposed to vampires, with which werebats are often confused, these lycanthropes are often more savage and less calculating than the shapeshifting undead. As though to prove a point, some werebats go out of their way to take down powerful vampire lords and commandeer the vampires' positions—though many also become slaves to such undead after underestimating their prowess.

Natural werebats typically look like normal members of their humanoid parent race, though they often have dark hair, lithe frames, severe features, and slightly pointed ears. They typically stand taller than normal for their race, but weigh significantly less.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Death Roll (Ex)**\  When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a werecrocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, the werecrocodile deals its bite damage, knocks the creature prone, and maintains the grapple.

\ **Sprint (Ex)**\  Once per minute, a werecrocodile can increase its land speed to 60 feet for 1 round.

Werecrocodiles merge the ruthless determination of a crocodile with the intelligence and adaptability of a humanoid. This fusion creates a maliciously cunning creature with no doubt of its own martial superiority.

In either humanoid or hybrid form, a wereshark is generally burly, has a mouth full of unusually large teeth, and typically has a personality that is both crude and bullying. They're bloodthirsty and are very easy to anger. They will jump into fights they have no stake in just to snap bones and draw blood.

Weresharks prefer life at sea or in port settlements commonly frequented by seagoing merchants and pirates. They can be found leading pirate gangs or loitering at seaside taverns accompanied by crowds of toadies. Since they get into fights so often, they try to stick close to the sea so they can escape into the water if they bite off more than they can chew. The other members of a wereshark's crew learn quickly that the boss is bound to skip out without much notice once a bigger fish comes along.
