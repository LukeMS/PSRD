Witch
######

To some, the witch is a hero; to others, a villain. In truth, it's never so simple, and how a witch uses her magic is often tied to her personal history.

Hex Channeler (Archetype)
**************************

A hex channeler is a witch who devotes herself either to life (healing the wounded and destroying the undead) or to death (slaying the living and aiding the undead).

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.witch#channel_energy`:

\ **Channel Energy (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, a hex channeler can call upon her patron to release a wave of energy from herself or her familiar. A good witch channels positive energy (like a good cleric), and an evil witch channels negative energy (like an evil cleric). A witch who is neither good nor evil must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the witch. The witch can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This ability otherwise functions as a cleric using channel energy, except the witch does not need a holy symbol to use this ability. The hex channeler uses her witch level as her cleric level for all other effects dependent upon channel energy (except increasing the amount of damage healed or dealt). The hex channeler can choose whether or not to include herself or her familiar in this effect.

This burst heals or deals 1d6 points of damage. Whenever the hex channeler is able to learn a new hex (including major and grand hexes, but not hexes gained through the :ref:`Extra Hex <advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#extra_hex>`\  feat), she can instead increase her channel energy amount by 1d6. 

This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.

Mountain Witch (Archetype)
***************************

Mountains can be sanctuaries for witches hunted by society. Here they form bonds with the spirits of the lofty reaches.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.witch#spells`:

\ **Spells**\ : A mountain witch replaces some of her patron spells with the following: 2nd—\ *magic stone*\ , 4th—:ref:`stone call <advancedplayersguide.spells.stonecall#stone_call>`\ , 6th—:ref:`meld into stone <corerulebook.spells.meldintostone#meld_into_stone>`\ , 8th—:ref:`stoneskin <corerulebook.spells.stoneskin#stoneskin>`\ , 10th—:ref:`wall of stone <corerulebook.spells.wallofstone#wall_of_stone>`\ , 12th—:ref:`stone tell <corerulebook.spells.stonetell#stone_tell>`\ , 14th—\ *statue*\ , 16th—:ref:`repel metal or stone <corerulebook.spells.repelmetalorstone#repel_metal_or_stone>`\ , 18th—:ref:`clashing rocks <advancedplayersguide.spells.clashingrocks#clashing_rocks>`\ .

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.witch#stone_spirit_hex`:

\ **Stone Spirit Hex**\ : A mountain witch can select hexes from the :ref:`shaman's stone spirit <advancedclassguide.classes.shaman#stone>`\  as if they were witch hexes. She uses her witch level as her shaman level to determine the effect of the hex, and Intelligence instead of Wisdom to determine its DC. This ability alters hex.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.witch#mountain_beast_empathy`:

\ **Mountain Beast Empathy (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a mountain witch can influence the attitude of mountain-dwelling animals, as the druid's wild empathy class feature but only on animals native to mountainous environments.
