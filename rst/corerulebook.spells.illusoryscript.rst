Illusory Script
================

\ **School**\  illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 minute per page

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (lead-based ink worth 50 gp)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.

\ **Duration**\  one day/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The \ *illusory script*\ appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character\ *.*

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\  implanted in the script by you at the time the \ *illusory script*\  spell was cast. The :ref:`suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion>`\  lasts only 30 minutes. Typical \ *suggestions*\  include "Close the book and leave," "Forget the existence of this note," and so forth. If successfully dispelled by :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ , the \ *illusory script*\ and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the :ref:`true seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\  spell with the :ref:`read magic <corerulebook.spells.readmagic#read_magic>`\  or :ref:`comprehend languages <corerulebook.spells.comprehendlanguages#comprehend_languages>`\  spell.
