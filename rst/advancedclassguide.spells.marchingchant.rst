Marching Chant
===============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  bard 2, cleric 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 minute

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level

\ **Duration**\  concentration

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

You invigorate your allies, who can hustle as long as you continue to sing or chant (which requires your concentration). This movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. You can concentrate on this spell and hustle at the same time.
