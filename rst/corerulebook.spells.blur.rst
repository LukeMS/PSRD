Blur
=====

\ **School**\  illusion (glamer); \ **Level**\  bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  1 min./level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

A :ref:`see invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\  spell does not counteract the \ *blur*\ effect, but a :ref:`true seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\  spell does.

Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
