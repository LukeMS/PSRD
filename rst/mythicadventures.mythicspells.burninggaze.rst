Burning Gaze
=============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`burning gaze <advancedplayersguide.spells.burninggaze#burning_gaze>`

You may focus your burning :ref:`gaze <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#gaze>`\  on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round it's on fire.

\ **Augmented**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spell's duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.
