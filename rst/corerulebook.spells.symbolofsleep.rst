Symbol of Sleep
================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates

This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the \ *symbol of sleep*\ instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 Ã— 10 minutes. Unlike with the :ref:`sleep <corerulebook.spells.sleep#sleep>`\  spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , \ *symbol of sleep*\ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \ *symbol of sleep*\ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

\ *Note*\ : Magic traps such as \ *symbol of sleep*\ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for \ *symbol of sleep*\ .
