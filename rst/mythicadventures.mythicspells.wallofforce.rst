Wall of Force
==============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`

The wall's hardness increases to 40, and its hit points increase to 30 per caster level. A non-mythic :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\  spell or :ref:`rod of cancellation <corerulebook.magicitems.rods#rod_of_cancellation>`\  negates a 10-foot-square section of a \ *mythic wall of force*\  for 1 round, after which the wall reforms at full strength. One side of the wall (chosen by you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a :ref:`repulsion <corerulebook.spells.repulsion#repulsion>`\  spell (using the DC :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`\  would have if it allowed a saving throw).
