Geas, Lesser
=============

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 round

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one living creature with 7 HD or less

\ **Duration**\  1 day/level or until discharged (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

A \ *lesser geas*\ places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a \ *geas*\ cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The \ *geased*\ creature must follow the given instructions until the \ *geas*\ is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the \ *lesser geas*\ for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the \ *lesser geas.*

A \ *lesser geas*\ (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by :ref:`break enchantment <corerulebook.spells.breakenchantment#break_enchantment>`\ , :ref:`limited wish <corerulebook.spells.limitedwish#limited_wish>`\ , :ref:`remove curse <corerulebook.spells.removecurse#remove_curse>`\ , :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\ , or :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\ . :ref:`Dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  does not affect a \ *lesser geas*\ .

Geas/Quest
===========

\ **School**\ enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\ bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

\ **Casting Time**\ 10 minutes

\ **Target**\ one living creature

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

This spell functions similarly to \ *lesser geas,*\ except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the \ *geas/quest*\ for 24 hours, it takes a –3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the \ *geas/quest.*

A :ref:`remove curse <corerulebook.spells.removecurse#remove_curse>`\  spell ends a \ *geas/quest*\ spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. :ref:`Break enchantment <corerulebook.spells.breakenchantment#break_enchantment>`\  does not end a \ *geas/quest*\ , but :ref:`limited wish <corerulebook.spells.limitedwish#limited_wish>`\ , :ref:`miracle <corerulebook.spells.miracle#miracle>`\ , and :ref:`wish <corerulebook.spells.wish#wish>`\  do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as \ *geas,*\ while clerics call the same spell \ *quest*\ .
