Dimensional Anchor
===================

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\ medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Effect**\  ray

\ **Duration**\  1 min./level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (object)

A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a \ *dimensional anchor*\ include :ref:`astral projection <corerulebook.spells.astralprojection#astral_projection>`\ , blink, :ref:`dimension door <corerulebook.spells.dimensiondoor#dimension_door>`\ , :ref:`ethereal jaunt <corerulebook.spells.etherealjaunt#ethereal_jaunt>`\ , :ref:`etherealness <corerulebook.spells.etherealness#etherealness>`\ , :ref:`gate <corerulebook.spells.gate#gate>`\ , :ref:`maze <corerulebook.spells.maze#maze>`\ , :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\ , :ref:`shadow walk <corerulebook.spells.shadowwalk#shadow_walk>`\ , :ref:`teleport <corerulebook.spells.teleport#teleport>`\ , and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a \ *gate*\ or :ref:`teleportation circle <corerulebook.spells.teleportationcircle#teleportation_circle>`\  for the duration of the spell.

A \ *dimensional anchor*\ does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, \ *dimensional anchor*\ does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
