Calcific Touch
===============

\ **School**\  transmutation [earth]; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature or creatures touched (up to one per level)

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude partial; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. :ref:`Break enchantment <corerulebook.spells.breakenchantment#break_enchantment>`\ , :ref:`restoration <corerulebook.spells.restoration#restoration>`\ , or :ref:`stone to flesh <corerulebook.spells.stonetoflesh#stone_to_flesh>`\  can reverse the effects of :ref:`calcific touch <advancedplayersguide.spells.calcifictouch#calcific_touch>`\ .
