You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates the Material Plane. This thickened planar conjunction slows movement through the area to a crawl. Creatures moving through \ *condensed ether*\  (even incorporeal creatures), move at only half their normal speed and can't take 5-foot steps. This slowing of movement doesn't stack with :ref:`solid fog <corerulebook.spells.solidfog#solid_fog>`\  or similar effects. Creatures within \ *condensed ether*\  take a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and \ *condensed ether*\  prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even magic rays and similar ranged attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks into or passing through \ *condensed ether*\ . This miss chance is not based on concealment, and Blind-Fight, :ref:`true seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\ , and similar effects do not reduce it.
