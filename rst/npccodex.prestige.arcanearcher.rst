Clairian Arrowsong
===================

The daughter of a pair of academics, Clairian Arrowsong was never interested in the studious pursuits her parents encouraged. From an early age, Clairian showed promise as both an excellent archer and bard, despite her parents' misgivings about both "hobbies." In the hours she was supposed to be studying in solitude, she escaped to hear the orators and bards who congregated outside of the city's university. But not until she saw her first archery tournament did she find her real passion. None but her parents were surprised when, as a young woman, she ran away with a sorcerer who served as a soothsayer on the tournament circuit. 

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  For extra coin and adventure, Clairian hires herself out as an archer to local princelings, bandit lords, and thieves' guilds. Though she serves with skill, she would rather surrender than die for another's cause. 

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Quick with song and laughter, Clairian doesn't take the plights of others too seriously. She would rather live the good life and have fun than be tied down to lords or obligations.

Tris Darkjester
================

It's said that even a few demons that have crossed Tris's path found her a little too malicious for their taste. The gnome's odd looks hide the heart of a capricious and sadistic killer. She enjoys watching other creatures die, burning in arcane fire or crackling and freezing from the energy of her dangerous bow. 

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Tris often strikes without any clear reason or purpose. She does it just to feed her morbid sense of fun, or to see if she can find a new way to murder. 

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Though she doesn't like to be, Tris can be patient. She sometimes joins a group of adventurers on some quest or another just to see how she can subtly bring about the demise of a few members before they find her out and she can slay them with impunity.
