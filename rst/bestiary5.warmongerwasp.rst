Warmonger Wasp
***************

This wasplike creature seems to be partially made of metal. Its wings create an iridescent glow as it buzzes through the air.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Poison (Ex)**\  Sting—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 17; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d4 Dex; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves.

\ **Static Discharge (Su)**\  Once every 1d4 rounds as part of a move action that's taken to fly at least 10 feet, a warmonger wasp's wings can discharge a bolt of electricity to a range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Like the more powerful :ref:`retriever <bestiary.retriever#retriever>`\ , the warmonger wasp is a construct built from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of the Abyss itself. Partially organic and partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve demonic armies as air support in large battles. Their electricity-based explosions work well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no effect on demons. Warmonger wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do their bidding. Warmonger wasps are only intelligent enough to understand simple commands, and even then they generally understand only commands universally associated with battlefield conditions.

A warmonger wasp is about 10 feet long, has a 20-foot wingspan, and weighs 1,200 pounds.

Conjuring a Warmonger Wasp
***************************

Although a warmonger wasp is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either a :ref:`planar ally <corerulebook.spells.planarally>`\  or :ref:`planar binding <corerulebook.spells.planarbinding>`\  spell. The spellcaster must take care when doing so, however, using specially prepared incenses, the secretions of rare and violent insects, and complex diagrams drawn with expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the wasp attack the spellcaster upon the spell's completion. These components cost 15,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including the required Charisma check to browbeat the creature into servitude with :ref:`planar binding <corerulebook.spells.planarbinding>`\ , as well as :ref:`planar ally <corerulebook.spells.planarally>`\ 's requirement to pay the conjured creature).

.. _`bestiary5.warmongerwasp#massacre_wasp`:

Massacre Wasp
**************

Warmonger wasps grow organically from protoplasmic flesh and chaos, so it's no surprise that, unlike many constructs, each warmonger wasp has a uniquely terrible appearance, and the wasps warp, twist, and mutate over time. While in most cases, significant mutations prove crippling and ultimately cause the wasp's death, in rare cases, the mutated wasp reaches a new state of evolution and becomes a massacre wasp: a more powerful version of the warmonger wasp that is capable of strategizing and leading other warmonger wasps in battlefield maneuvers. Massacre wasps usually have the advanced or giant simple template as well as either 6 evolution points' worth of :ref:`summoner eidolon evolutions <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.summoner#evolutions>`\  or other monster abilities of a similar power level and scope. Massacre wasps' static discharge works once per round instead of once every 1d4 rounds.
