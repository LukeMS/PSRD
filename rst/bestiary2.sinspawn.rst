Special Abilities
==================
\ **Martial Proficiency (Ex)**\  Sinspawn are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, armor, and shields (except tower shields).
\ **Sin-Scent (Su)**\  Sinspawn have :ref:`scent <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#scent>`\  against creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For example, wrathful sinspawn can :ref:`scent <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#scent>`\  creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular sinspawn can :ref:`scent <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#scent>`\ .
\ **Sinful Bite (Su)**\  A creature bitten by a sinspawn is overwhelmed with sinful thoughts (DC 12 Will save negates). These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten a second time is staggered for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. :ref:`Calm emotions <corerulebook.spells.calmemotions#calm_emotions>`\ , :ref:`remove curse <corerulebook.spells.removecurse#remove_curse>`\ , or :ref:`break enchantment <corerulebook.spells.breakenchantment#break_enchantment>`\  negates the effects of sinful bite. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Sinspawn are corrupted products of magic used by spellcasters in a past era as shock troops for their armies. Literally the embodiment of a sin made flesh, they are sentient abominations of distilled ectoplasm imprinted with the soul-image of slain creatures that possessed an abundance of a particular sin.
