Special Abilities
==================

\ **Brand of the Impenitent (Su)**\  Three times per day, a balisse can brand a target within 30 feet (Will DC 19 negates) with a painless, glowing icon on its chest—usually the holy symbol of the deity or empyreal lord the balisse serves. This brand lasts for a number of days equal to the balisse's Hit Dice (10 days for most balisses). Anyone who attacks the branded target gains a +2 sacred bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Balisses, sometimes called confessor angels, appear to good individuals on the horns of moral dilemmas or who are struggling with crises of faith. Though balisses may appear stern and unyielding, they prefer to guide individuals to their own moral decisions rather than ordering them to conform to a specific ideal of good, knowing that the goodness found on one's own is stronger than mere obedience. Balisses are formed from the souls of individuals who committed evil acts but were later redeemed and died while living an exemplary, moral life.

Some balisses seek out mortals in need of their help, while others are given specific assignments by deities or empyreal lords. Balisses are used to dealing with stubbornness, and have an eternity's worth of patience. Though they brook no physical attacks, they can endure almost any other hostility for the sake of their mission.

The average balisse is 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Countersong (Su)**\  A choral can attempt a Perform (sing) check to counter magic effects that depend on sound. This ability functions as the bard ability of the same name.

\ **Harmonize (Sp)**\  When chorals work together, they can use their complementary voices to create mystical harmonies. Two or more chorals within 60 feet of one another can use \ *calm emotions*\  or \ *heroism*\  as a spell-like ability, four or more chorals can use \ *shout*\ , and six or more chorals can use :ref:`greater heroism <corerulebook.spells.heroism#heroism_greater>`\  or :ref:`holy word <corerulebook.spells.holyword#holy_word>`\ . Only the choral that actually casts the spell-like ability in question must take a standard action to achieve this effect—the other chorals need only take swift actions during the same round.

\ **Piercing Hymn (Su)**\  As a standard action, a choral can launch a concentrated blast of sonic energy from its mouth as a ranged touch attack. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment and deals 4d6 points of sonic damage. Any creature struck by a piercing hymn must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Choral angels are singers of great skill, and their ranks fill the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants. They manifest from the spirits of the pious dead who had exceptional musical talent. While they aren't soldiers, chorals can defend themselves with their magical voices. Chorals sometimes visit the Material Plane with auspicious messages for mortals.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Empyrean Insights (Ex)**\  Empyreans have insight into the way creatures act, and it serves them well in battle. Empyreans gain an insight bonus to their Armor Class equal to their Charisma bonuses.

\ **Heed No Call (Ex)**\  Empyreans are ancient beyond measure and directly serve the gods. They are immune to all calling spells, unless they choose to allow themselves to be called.

\ **Lucent Arms (Ex)**\  An empyrean infuses its weapons with its own inner light. Any weapon an empyrean wields gains the \ *holy*\  and \ *merciful*\  special abilities. The empyrean can suppress the \ *merciful*\  special ability on command as normal. An empyrean needs no ammunition for its bow (or for any other ranged weapon it may possess), as it can simply fire arrows of light. An empyrean's weapons count as having the \ *brilliant energy*\  special ability whenever it would be beneficial to the empyrean.

\ **Lucent Body (Ex)**\  Each empyrean is formed of the ancient essence of good. Its lucent body melds perfectly with its armor and clothing, forming a single whole. An empyrean gains a sacred bonus to its Armor Class equal to the total armor bonus of its infused armor (typically +14 from infused \ *+5 full plate*\ ), but it suffers no restrictions or penalties for wearing armor. An empyrean can never gain an armor bonus or natural armor bonus to its Armor Class through any means.

\ **Spells**\  Empyreans can cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

Empyreans are a race of ancient angels created by the gods before the dawn of mortalkind. Among the angelic hosts, empyreans serve outside of the usual chain of command. Standing 15 feet tall and clad in the trappings of mortality, which wrap their brilliant forms in a shape mortals and other angels can easily understand, empyreans are physical embodiments of the good energy of a deity or deific being, and they answer only to that higher power.

While other angels arise from an amalgam of good souls or the soul of an ascended mortal, the birth of a new empyrean is a momentous event, for it occurs only if another empyrean is slain. To fill the void, the remaining empyreans temporarily become receptive to the energy of good deities other than their original progenitors, which can eventually cause an empyrean to split in two. The offspring empyrean shares many of the memories and personality traits of the original, but its power is influenced by the deity who sparked its creation.

Empyreans serve as secret agents for deities—operatives who can be trusted to perform sensitive tasks, especially those that require a long view. Unlike solars, who often become slayers of great evils, empyreans rarely pick fights, but when they do, they prefer to use their deities' favorite weapons.

.. _`bestiary5.angels#empyrean_paragons`:

Empyrean Paragons
******************

Empyrean paragons stand among the most powerful servants of good deities, and a given deity can have at most one paragon. Empyrean paragons vary from CR 23 to CR 30. Each paragon possesses a unique ability tied to its deity. The following are a few examples of such powers.

\ **Paragon of the Dawn (Ex)**\ : The paragon glows like the sun, shining light in a radius of up to 1 mile. This light automatically shines through and dispels all effects with the darkness descriptor, and counts as true sunlight for all purposes (including harming undead that are vulnerable to sunlight).

\ **Paragon of the Rose (Su)**\ : The paragon is surrounded by rose petals and songbirds. It gains a 30-foot aura that has the effects of :ref:`euphoric tranquility <advancedplayersguide.spells.euphorictranquility#euphoric_tranquility>`\  and that affects creatures for as long as they remain in the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that succeeds at its Will save ends the effect completely, but if the effect expires naturally, the creature can accept the effects of an \ *atonement*\  spell to change its alignment to neutral good. Either way, the creature is immune to this ability's effects for 24 hours.

\ **Paragon of the Shield (Ex)**\ : The paragon's protective aura is extraordinarily powerful. It acts as a :ref:`globe of invulnerability <corerulebook.spells.globeofinvulnerability#globe_of_invulnerability>`\  instead of a \ *lesser globe of invulnerability*\ , and all allies within the aura except the paragon take half damage from all attacks.

\ **Paragon of the Sword (Sp, Su)**\ : The paragon's blade is fueled by honor. The paragon is lawful good and gains :ref:`bestow grace of the champion <ultimatemagic.spells.bestowgraceofthechampion#bestow_grace_of_the_champion>`\  as a constant spell-like ability, except the paragon counts as a 20th-level paladin for the purposes of lay on hands and smite evil and gains the number of daily uses of each that it would as a 20th-level paladin.
