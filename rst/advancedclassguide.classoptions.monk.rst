Monk
#####

The disciplines and mystic orders of the monk are varied as the animals that roam the forest. Some of these orders treat combat as an art, while others treat it as an element. The following show examples of both philosophies.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#kata_master_(archetype)`:

Kata Master (Archetype)
************************

The kata master takes the visual aspect of his martial art to its logical extreme, harnessing his flowing movements and skilled maneuvers as a psychological weapon against his enemies. A kata master forsakes the mental discipline of his more contemplative brethren in favor of flamboyant exhibitions. He often performs in staged fights and tournaments, utilizing stylized forms to amaze the audience and shock and dismay his opponents.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#panache`:

\ **Panache**\ : At 1st level, a kata master gains the swashbuckler's panache class feature. At the start of each day, a kata master gains a number of panache points equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 1). His panache goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot exceed his Charisma bonus (minimum 1). A kata master gains the swashbuckler's derring-do and dodging panache deeds. A kata master can use an unarmed strike or a monk special weapon in place of a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon for the purpose of swashbuckler class features and deeds. This ability replaces stunning fist.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#menacing_swordplay`:

\ **Menacing Swordplay (Ex)**\ : At 3rd level, a kata master gains the swashbuckler's menacing swordplay deed. This ability replaces still mind.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#ki_pool`:

\ **Ki Pool (Su)**\ : At 4th level, a kata master can treat ki points as panache points for any swashbuckler deed gained through this archetype. This ability modifies ki pool.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#targeted_strike`:

\ **Targeted Strike (Ex)**\ : At 7th level, a kata master gains the swashbuckler's targeted strike deed. This ability replaces wholeness of body.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#dizzying_defense`:

\ **Dizzying Defense (Ex)**\ : At 15th level, a kata master gains the dizzying defense swashbuckler deed. This ability replaces quivering palm.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#wildcat_archetype`: `advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#wildcat_(archetype)`_

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#wildcat_(archetype)`:

Wildcat (Archetype)
********************

A wildcat is a student of the school of hard knocks who dedicates himself to learning how to take down foes by any means necessary. A wildcat isn't afraid to smash a tankard over a foe's head, stomp an opponent's foot, gouge an eye, or generally create mayhem to gain any possible advantage.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#ready_for_anything`:

\ **Ready for Anything (Ex)**\ : At 3rd level, a wildcat gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks to act in a surprise round. This ability replaces still mind.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#brawler_maneuver_training_(ex)`:

\ **Brawler Maneuver Training (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, a wildcat gains additional training with the :ref:`dirty trick combat maneuver <advancedplayersguide.advancednewrules#dirty_trick>`\ . He gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when attempting a dirty trick and a +1 bonus to his CMD to resist this maneuver.

At 7th, 10th, and 16th levels, a wildcat becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to his CMD to resist that combat maneuver. In addition, each of the bonuses granted by previous maneuver training increases by 1. For example, when a wildcat reaches 7th level, he gains a +1 bonus on one type of combat maneuver and +1 to his CMD to resist that combat maneuver, and the bonuses for the dirty trick combat maneuver increase to +2.

This ability replaces ki pool and high jump.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#improvised_weapon_mastery`:

\ **Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex)**\ : Starting at 4th level, a wildcat's damage with improvised weapons increases. When wielding an improvised weapon, he uses the unarmed strike damage of a monk 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (minimum monk level 1st). For example, a 6th-level Medium wildcat wielding a broken bottle deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon's normal 1d4. If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The wildcat can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of his adjusted unarmed strike damage. This decision must be declared before the attack roll is attempted. This ability replaces slow fall.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#wildcat_bonus_feat`:

\ **Bonus Feat**\ : A wildcat adds the following feats to his list of bonus feats at 6th level: :ref:`Improved Dirty Trick <advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#improved_dirty_trick>`\ , :ref:`Improved Reposition <advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#improved_reposition>`\ , and :ref:`Improved Steal <advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#improved_steal>`\ . He adds the following feats to his list of bonus feats at 10th level: :ref:`Quick Dirty Trick <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#quick_dirty_trick>`\ , :ref:`Quick Reposition <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#quick_reposition>`\ , and :ref:`Quick Steal <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#quick_steal>`\ .

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#knockout`:

\ **Knockout (Ex)**\ : At 9th level, a wildcat can unleash a devastating attack once per day that can instantly knock a target unconscious. He must announce this intent before making his attack roll. If the wildcat's strike is successful and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wildcat's level + the higher of the wildcat's Strength and Dexterity modifiers) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, an unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 12th level, a wildcat can use this ability twice per day. This ability replaces improved evasion and abundant step.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#turn_the_tables`:

\ **Turn the Tables (Ex)**\ : At 13th level, whenever an opponent fails a combat maneuver check against the wildcat, it provokes an attack of opportunity from the wildcat. This ability replaces diamond soul.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.monk#dirty_blow`:

\ **Dirty Blow (Ex)**\ : At 19th level, when a wildcat succeeds at a dirty trick combat maneuver, he can deal his unarmed strike damage to that opponent. This ability replaces empty body.
