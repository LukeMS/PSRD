Special Abilities
==================

\ **Blood Drain (Su)**\  A blood golem heals 5 hit points each round it drains blood.

\ **Clotted Skin (Ex)**\  A blood golem can congeal its surface into a hard skin as a full-round action, allowing it to assume a vaguely humanoid form. With its skin, it gains DR 5/bludgeoning, natural armor +6, and speed 30, but loses its amorphous and compression abilities. It can liquefy this skin as a full-round action, losing its DR and natural armor, changing its speed to 10 feet, and regaining the amorphous and compression abilities. The golem normally maintains its congealed skin, liquefying itself only when it has to pass through obstacles that would hinder its solid form.

\ **Immunity to Magic (Ex)**\  A blood golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.

* Cure spells affect it as if it were a living creature, but only cure the minimum amount of damage.

* Spells and effects that specifically affect blood (such as :ref:`boiling blood <ultimatemagic.spells.boilingblood#boiling_blood>`\ ) affect it normally.

\ **Vulnerable to Bleed (Ex)**\  Bleed effects, blood drain, and attacks that target a creature's blood affect a blood golem normally. The golem can spend a full-round action to harden its clotted outer shell to end a bleed effect.

A blood golem is an animate mass of living blood. It can creep about in liquid form like an ooze, or create a thick skin made up of coagulated blood that allows it to walk upright like a person.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Aquatic Reconstruction (Ex)**\  Whenever a coral golem is touching a body of saltwater of a size equal to or greater than its own size, it gains fast healing 5.

\ **Immunity to Magic (Ex)**\  A coral golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.

* Any spell with the water descriptor heals a coral golem 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 10d6).

* :ref:`Transmute rock to mud <corerulebook.spells.transmuterocktomud#transmute_rock_to_mud>`\  slows a coral golem (as the :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  spell) for 1d6 rounds (no save).

* :ref:`Transmute mud to rock <corerulebook.spells.transmutemudtorock#transmute_mud_to_rock>`\  increases the golem's bleed damage to 2d6 for 3 rounds.

* :ref:`Soften earth and stone <corerulebook.spells.softenearthandstone#soften_earth_and_stone>`\  causes a coral golem to lose its damage reduction for 3 rounds.

Coral golems are constructs made entirely of colonies of living coral drawn from the ocean. While their sharpened appendages are capable of performing tasks that require meticulous precision, they are equally useful in martial combat. Wizards and sorcerers employ coral golems to collect delicate specimens of plant life from local beaches, spear and retrieve fish from the ocean for meals, and protect valuable locations such as their masters' homes or veins of minerals and other potent resources. A coral golem is 9 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Discorporate (Ex)**\  A junk golem can break apart into its constituent pieces as a standard action, becoming a swarming mass of Tiny parts. It gains the swarm subtype, its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this form, it gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage and inflicts disease, but loses its slam attacks. It can revert back to its normal form as a full-round action.

\ **Disease (Ex)**\  \ *Tetanus*\ : Slam—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 12; \ *onset*\  1d6 days; \ *frequency*\  1 day; \ *effect*\  1d4 Dex damage. Each time someone takes Dexterity damage from tetanus, there's a 50% chance his jaw muscles stiffen, preventing speech and the use of spells with verbal components for 24 hours; \ *cure*\  2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Immunity to Magic (Ex)**\ A junk golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a junk golem, as noted below.

* A :ref:`shatter <corerulebook.spells.shatter#shatter>`\  spell causes a junk golem to discorporate and dazes it for 1 round.

* A :ref:`grease <corerulebook.spells.grease#grease>`\  spell affects the junk golem as if it were :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\  for 1d6 rounds and ends any :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  effect on it.

* An :ref:`arcane lock <corerulebook.spells.arcanelock#arcane_lock>`\  or :ref:`hold portal <corerulebook.spells.holdportal#hold_portal>`\  spell affects the junk golem as if it were a :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  spell for 1d6 rounds and breaks any :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\  effect on it.

* A :ref:`wood shape <corerulebook.spells.woodshape#wood_shape>`\  or :ref:`rusting grasp <corerulebook.spells.rustinggrasp#rusting_grasp>`\  spell deals 2d6 points of damage to a junk golem.

\ **Junk Repair (Su)**\  A junk golem has fast healing 2 when in an area with a high concentration of debris, such as a refuse heap or the area created by another junk golem's discorporate ability.

Junk golems are assembled from trash and spare parts, and often leave trails of garbage in their wakes.

\ **Treasure**\  none

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Conditional Sentience (Su)**\  A wax golem constructed to look like a humanoid (whether a particular individual or not) has a small chance of gaining sentience and genuinely believing it is a living creature. Each week, such a wax golem has a cumulative 1% chance of becoming sentient (on the second week the chance is 2%, the third week 3%, and so on), to a maximum of 5%. If it does attain sentience, the golem gains an Intelligence score of 10, retroactive skill points, feats dependent on its Hit Dice, and 1 class level with the potential to gain more. If it was crafted to resemble a specific individual, it also gains a +10 racial bonus on :ref:`Disguise <corerulebook.skills.disguise#disguise>`\  checks made to impersonate that individual. A sentient wax golem ventures into the world and tries to live a life similar to that of the person (or type of person) it resembles. However, if the sentient wax golem ever encounters the person it is modeled after, it attempts to stealthily kill that person and take her place. The only way for a sentient wax golem to lose its sentience is either to take an amount of fire damage equal to half its hit points (which melts its features away) or to be destroyed.

\ **Immunity to Magic (Ex)**\  A wax golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the fire descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.

* A magical attack that deals fire damage slows a wax golem (as the :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). In addition, for 3 rounds after taking fire damage, every time a wax golem uses its slam attack, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage due to its molten wax.

* A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow#slow>`\  effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wax golem gains no saving throw against cold effects.

A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking, well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person.

A wax golem can be constructed to resemble any person or creature.
