Persistent Image
=================

\ **School**\  illusion (figment); \ **Level**\  bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

This spell functions like :ref:`silent image <corerulebook.spells.silentimage#silent_image>`\ , except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish.
