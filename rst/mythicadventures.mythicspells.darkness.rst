Darkness
=========

\ **Source**\  :ref:`darkness <corerulebook.spells.darkness#darkness>`

The illumination level in the area drops to darkness regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Non-mythic spells and effects can't increase the light level in the area. Creatures with darkvision and the power to :ref:`see in darkness <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#see_in_darkness>`\  have difficulty seeing through this darkness, and can see as well as a human can in dim light. Creatures in the area of darkness take a â€“2 penalty on saves against :ref:`fear <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#fear>`\ .
