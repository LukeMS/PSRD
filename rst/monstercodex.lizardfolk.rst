Lizardfolk
***********

Lizardfolk are an ancient race whose origins are lost in time. They believe themselves to be as old as the world itself, claiming to have come into being alongside the dinosaurs. This belief has created a culture that stubbornly clings to tradition and antiquated technologies. Still, the lizardfolk strive on, their numbers dwindling as they retreat deeper into marshy wild places rather than interact with a world where faster-breeding warmbloods are making them increasingly irrelevant.

Female lizardfolk produce only a handful of eggs over their lifetimes. These eggs are delicate, and between changes in habitat, scarcity of food, and predation, few make it to term. In times of extreme starvation, a clutch could even become sustenance for a tribe rather than being allowed to hatch and become more mouths to feed.

Viable eggs require constant care. As with many reptiles, the unhatched young change sex in response to changes in temperature. Often, a tribe deliberately manipulates this phenomenon to ensure gender parity, which is of high importance when the survival of the next generation hangs in the balance. In contrast to the delicate eggs from which they hatch, young lizardfolk are extremely resilient, emerging with a full set of teeth and claws.

A race with such a slow reproductive cycle can ill afford the losses of war. Lizardfolk sometimes ally with other reptilian or amphibious species, but choose only those whose presence doesn't strain their territory's resources too far. A single dragon, a naga coven, or a herd of herbivorous dinosaurs can coexist comfortably with an established lizardfolk tribe, but sharing scarce land with numerous boggards or grippli would likely lead to conflict.

With the exception of lizard scions, most lizardfolk live to be between 60 and 80 years old. Both males and females continue to grow for their entire lives, and those rare few able to transcend the aging process (such as high-level druids or alchemists) could reach Large size around their 100th year. Both the size and extensive tribal knowledge of such individuals secure them positions of power within lizardfolk society, although they never attain the same spiritual reverence as lizard scions, who are thought to be reawakened remnants of the past.

An aging lizardfolk contributes to tribal life until the day of his death. Few settlements have the resources to support inactive members, and elders become teachers, healers, or nursery attendants. Even hatchlings are put to work once they achieve the necessary manual dexterity, weaving fishing nets, preparing food, or watching over their younger siblings. Since every one of these tasks is vital to a tribe's survival, hatchlings remain under supervision by at least one adult, but they still achieve a level of autonomy and responsibility that greatly exceeds that of humans at a similar age.

Most lizardfolk make their homes in rugged, well-constructed encampments in temperate swamps. Though the camps might seem unprotected to outsiders, lizardfolk carefully choose to inhabit defensible sections of rivers or marshes, especially places with multiple submerged entrances, hidden escape routes, and dry access for non-swimmers. Such camps usually house a single tribe that subsists off the immediate territory, supplementing with hunting forays farther afield during lean periods. Lizardfolk are most active during daylight hours, since they lack night vision, and prefer to retreat to the warmth and safety of their earthen lairs at sunset.

Lizardfolk are extremely insular, trading or allying only with groups they have established relationships with over an extended period. Even if their society were not so xenophobic, the work required to keep a tribe safe and fed means lizardfolk have little spare time for fraternization with outsiders. This can make encounters brief and curt, and an envoy's diplomatic tricks won't get her very far with a shaman who must still prepare food, cast protective spells on his clutch, and treat the wounds of his warriors. Those who do spend significant time with lizardfolk, however, find that the creatures have a rich oral tradition that passes down thousands of years' worth of knowledge and wisdom.

Lizardfolk rarely permit outsiders to enter their camps, and instead meet them at sub-camps or at prominent natural landmarks. Lizardfolk impose no cultural or religious requirements on their allies or trade partners, and expect the same treatment in return, but they might make ecological demands that can cause friction. Humanoids often mistake such demands for superstition or the misguided animism of "savages," but it's rare for lizardfolk to place any religious significance on the land itself. Instead, any landmark they decide to protect they do so out of concern for preserving the environment, since even a slight change to their habitat could have deadly ramifications.

Though lizardfolk are not evil, their practicality can sometimes seem abhorrent to other races, especially when it manifests in practices like cannibalism. To a lizardfolk, meat is meat, and during times of scarcity it would be an insult to those fallen in battle to let them rot rather than use their flesh to feed the tribe.

This innate pragmatism also manifests in lizardfolk's societal relations. Crime, politicking, and infighting are almost as common in settled lizardfolk populations as they are in human settlements, but a strong sense of natural law prevents these societies from descending into chaos. Tribal justice is meted out swiftly and fairly, with most disputes settled in non-fatal combat between the parties involved. In some cases these disputes may be handled by a proxy duel, with one or both sides sponsoring a champion.

New Rules
##########

The following rules include an archetype, an oracle curse, feats, and spells, all of which are favored by lizardfolk.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#lizardfolk_archetype`:

Lizardfolk Archetype
*********************

Wise and revered druids preserve the lizardfolk's past.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#ancient_guardian_(druid)`:

Ancient Guardian (Druid)
=========================

Ancient guardians revere nature and draw power from its divine energies, but also protect the customs, histories, and lore of their tribe and race. They act as ambassadors and protectors of the old ways, nurturing their tribe's growth and holding back civilization's corruptive influence.

\ **Ancient Arms**\ : An ancient guardian can't wield weapons made primarily of metal. She is proficient with only the club, dart, quarterstaff, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form she assumes with wild shape. Using a prohibited weapon renders her unable to cast druid spells or use any of her druid supernatural or spell-like class abilities while wielding the weapon and for 24 hours after ceasing to wield it. This alters the druid's normal weapon proficiencies.

\ **Community Bond (Ex)**\ : At 1st level, an ancient guardian must choose the domain nature bond ability and select from the following domains: Community, Healing, :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\ , Protection, or Repose. This ability alters nature bond.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#patience_of_nature`:

\ **Patience of Nature (Ex)**\ : An ancient guardian does not gain wild empathy at 1st level. Instead, at 2nd level, an ancient guardian adds :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (oratory), and :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  to her list of class skills and gains an insight bonus equal to half her druid level on such checks. This ability replaces wild empathy.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#ancient_ways`:

\ **Ancient Ways (Ex)**\ : At 3rd level, an ancient guardian increases any climb, fly, or swim speeds she has or gains via her wild shape ability by 10 feet. This ability replaces trackless step and woodland stride.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#dispel_hostility`:

\ **Dispel Hostility (Su)**\ : An ancient guardian doesn't gain spontaneous casting at 1st level. Instead, at 3rd level, she can channel stored spell energy into a spell capable of dispelling hostile thoughts and strong emotions. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast :ref:`calm emotions <corerulebook.spells.calmemotions#calm_emotions>`\  . Instead of the normal Will saving throw for that spell, the DC of a :ref:`calm emotions <corerulebook.spells.calmemotions#calm_emotions>`\  spell cast with this ability is 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian's druid level + her Wisdom modifier. This ability replaces spontaneous casting.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#unimpeachable`:

\ **Unimpeachable (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, an ancient guardian gains a +4 bonus on saves against enchantments. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#undo_artifice`:

\ **Undo Artifice (Sp)**\ : At 13th level, an ancient guardian gains the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component raw materials. This acts as the spell :ref:`polymorph any object <corerulebook.spells.polymorphanyobject#polymorph_any_object>`\ ,  but works on magical or nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike :ref:`polymorph any object <corerulebook.spells.polymorphanyobject#polymorph_any_object>`\ , this ability can't be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian's druid level + her Wisdom modifier). Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp of the item's value. An ancient guardian can use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#lizardfolk_oracle_curse`:

Lizardfolk Oracle Curse
************************

The following oracle curse is available to lizardfolk.

\ **Cold-Blooded**\ : Your blood turns sluggish without sufficient heat, and you must seek warmth and shelter earlier than most. This oracle curse is common among lizardfolk and other oracles with the reptilian subtype. You take a –4 penalty on saves against cold spells and effects, and whenever you fail such a saving throw, you are staggered for 1 round. You can survive without food four times longer than a typical creature of your species before you begin to starve. At 5th level, poisons affecting you have their onset time doubled and last half as long if they end after a set time (for example, a poison with a frequency of 1/round for 6 rounds would instead have a frequency of 1/round for 3 rounds). Poisons with no onset time gain an onset time of 1 round. At 10th level, whenever an action you have readied is triggered, you can take an additional move action at half your speed—along with your readied action—even if you have already taken a move action that round. At 15th level, you can take an additional move action a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. You can take these additional move actions only on your turn, and can take only one of these extra move actions per turn.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#lizardfolk_feats`:

Lizardfolk Feats
*****************

The following feats enhance lizardfolk's natural abilities, though Aquatic Adaption can be taken by mutated or unique individuals of any race who meet the prerequisites.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#aquatic_adaption`:

Aquatic Adaption
=================

You've developed a strange but useful quirk for your race—you can breathe underwater.

\ **Prerequisite**\ : Hold breath.

\ **Benefit**\ : You can breathe water as well as air.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#dangerous_tail_(combat)`:

Dangerous Tail (Combat)
========================

You have trained your tail into a powerful weapon, and wield it with deadly skill.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Base attack bonus +5, Lizardfolk.

\ **Benefit**\ : You gain a tail swipe attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the attack is made at your full base attack bonus – 5. If the tail swipe hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming you are Medium) + 1/2 your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit against a target with your tail swipe, as a free action you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that target.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#swift_swimmer`:

Swift Swimmer
==============

You are a faster swimmer than other members of your race.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Lizardfolk, swim speed.

\ **Benefit**\ : Your swim speed increases by 15 feet.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#lizardfolk_spells`:

Lizardfolk Spells
******************

The following spells are used by lizardfolk and other spellcasters with the reptilian subtype. While the spells are not restricted to lizardfolk casters, individuals from warm-blooded races might have a difficult time learning them without first spending time earning the trust of lizardfolk instructors, perhaps by completing dangerous tasks on behalf of the tribe.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#endothermic_touch`:

Endothermic Touch
==================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  druid 1, shaman 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (a small bit of snakeskin)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one living creature that has the dragon type or the reptilian subtype

\ **Duration**\ 1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ Fort negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\ yes

This spell slows the metabolism and other bodily functions of a creature for a short amount of time. The target is staggered and moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), but it can hold its breath for twice as long as normal.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#scale_spikes`:

Scale Spikes
=============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  alchemist 2, bloodrager 2, druid 2, ranger 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (a small thorn)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one living creature/level that is a reptile, has the dragon type, or has the reptilian subtype, and that also has a natural armor bonus of at least +1

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fort negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\ yes (harmless)

When the target is affected by this spell, its scales grow jagged spikes. These spikes act like \ *+1 armor spikes*\  . The subject is automatically considered proficient with these scale spikes.

.. _`monstercodex.lizardfolk#scale_spikes_greater`:

Scale Spikes, Greater
======================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  alchemist 4, bloodrager 4, druid 3, ranger 3, shaman 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (a bit of thistle)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one living creature/level that is a reptile, has the dragon type, or has the reptilian subtype, and also has a natural armor bonus of at least +1

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level

\ **Saving Throw**\ Fort negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

This spell functions like \ *scale spikes*\ , except that the spikes growing out of the scales have an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls equal to +1 for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow the spikes to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.

Revered members of the tribe, rattlers are the keepers of tradition and leaders of the sacred dances. They are the ones who remember the ancient songs of lizardfolk glory and use them to train the youth, educating each new generation in the practices and secrets that have kept their people safe in their swamps for millennia.

Though called rattlers, these lizardfolk are as much storytellers as musicians, propagating the oral traditions of their people. As a result, they are valued as much for their wisdom as for their ability to bolster the tribe's hunters and warriors in combat—though this latter responsibility admittedly defines the role in which most other humanoid races encounter them. Though a rattler might or might not be the leader of a tribe, she is often asked to sit in judgment over internal conflicts, to act as an ambassador to other tribes, or to advise a tribe's chieftains and elders so that their decisions reflect the wisdom of the past.

Lizardfolk rattlers are often tribal elders, but when youths show a propensity for bardic magic or a particular passion for the old stories and shamanistic rituals, a tribe's existing rattlers might choose to take them in and train them as the rattlers of the next generation. This practice is crucial, as it can take most of a lifetime to learn all the stories, and a tribe never wants to risk losing ties to their history because of the sudden death of the tribe's rattler to old age or in battle.

Most lizardfolk feel a deep connection to dinosaurs, seeing in the fearsome beasts an obvious kinship, and considering them a symbol of the once-great lizardfolk civilization. As a result, many tribes attempt to domesticate dinosaurs as beasts of burden or war—with varying degrees of success.

Those warriors able to single-handedly pacify and train dinosaur mounts win the respect of their tribes. Dinosaur-riding lizardfolk champions are famed battle leaders among their tribes, and often become chieftains of their people.

Lizardfolk sorcerers can have any bloodline, but most claim (rightly or not) that their magic is the result of ancient interbreeding with majestic dragons. With the blood of dragons coursing through her veins, the sorcerer is respected and feared by members of her tribe. They could see her as an omen—of good or ill—and might send her away to live on the outskirts of tribal land if she can't quickly learn to control her powers. Nevertheless, though the sorcerer might stand apart from the rest of her tribe, she almost always comes to her kin's defense in their times of need.

The clutch mother seeks only to protect her ways and her kind. She faces the onslaught of civilization with diplomacy, reason, and patience.

While other races might see guarding the children as a waste of one's best warriors, lizardfolk inherently value defense over offense. They think warm-blooded races are insane for sending all their capable combatants off to fight in distant wars, leaving only the aged and infirm to protect the children. Clutch mother (or occasionally clutch father) is a position of prominence and prestige, and many lizardfolk warriors compete eagerly to prove themselves worthy of this great responsibility.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Lizardfolk Blood (Ex)**\  A lizard scion counts as a lizardfolk for all effects related to race.

Every few generations, a lizard scion is born to a lizardfolk tribe. With twice the life span of a typical lizardfolk and a large and muscular stature, a scion typically rises to become the leader of her tribe. Lizardfolk show great—often unquestioning—devotion to scions, believing they are blessings from the spirits and divine in nature. In many ways, tribes see them as living monuments to the lost greatness of their people, singing songs of an era when every lizardfolk was as large and impressive as the scion.

A lizard scion is not officially recognized until her 100th birthday, though many might suspect that she is one. At that point, the tribe holds a ceremony in which they present the newly titled lizard scion with a special war trident as a mark of status. These ancient tridents are never used by ordinary lizardfolk, and most have been handed down through their tribe for generations, sometimes sitting untouched for hundreds of years until the naming of a new lizard scion.

Some lizard scions become great protectors and voices of wisdom among their people, leading a tribe to previously unknown accomplishments and stability within its hidden enclave. Others attempt to build alliances with other lizardfolk tribes or even unite two tribes into one. A tribe of lizardfolk being systematically pushed out of its ancestral territory, however, might see the coming of a lizard scion as a sign that war is imminent, and could be spurred to take up arms once and for all against the so-called "civilized" encroachers.

There are rumors that deep in some jungles or swamps there live entire tribes of dinosaur-herding lizard scions that have bred true as a race, but such stories may be little more than the overactive imaginations of explorers and treasure hunters.

Lizard scions average 10 feet in height and 500 pounds, though this can vary by tribe and age. Unlike boggard priest-kings, lizard scions are never fat, but rather hugely muscled specimens with excellent reflexes.

Lizardfolk Encounters
######################

Encounters with lizardfolk typically occur near or within remote enclaves in swamps and jungles. Lizardfolk shun territory controlled by the more "civilized" races unless on a mission for their priests, on a scouting mission to keep tabs on the movement of encroaching neighbors, led by an aggressive lizard scion, or pushed to desperation.
