Bear's Endurance
=================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bear)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  1 min./level

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to :ref:`Constitution <corerulebook.gettingstarted#constitution>`\ , which adds the usual benefits to hit points, :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  saves, :ref:`Constitution <corerulebook.gettingstarted#constitution>`\  checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in :ref:`Constitution <corerulebook.gettingstarted#constitution>`\  score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's :ref:`Constitution <corerulebook.gettingstarted#constitution>`\  drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.
