Fly
====

\ **Source**\  :ref:`fly <corerulebook.spells.fly>`

The fly speed changes to 120 feet (or 80 feet if the target is wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load) with perfect maneuverability. When the duration expires, the target is protected by :ref:`feather fall <corerulebook.spells.featherfall#feather_fall>`\  for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target adds your tier on Reflex saves and as a dodge bonus to AC. It gains these bonuses only while flying.
