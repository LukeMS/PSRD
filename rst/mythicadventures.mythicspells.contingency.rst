Contingency
============

\ **Source**\  :ref:`contingency <corerulebook.spells.contingency#contingency>`

You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one :ref:`contingency <corerulebook.spells.contingency#contingency>`\  spell upon it at a time unless it also knows \ *mythic contingency*\ . The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.

\ **Augmented (5th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of \ *mythic contingency*\  decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.
