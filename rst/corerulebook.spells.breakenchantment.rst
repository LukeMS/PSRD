Break Enchantment
==================

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  bard 4, cleric 5, paladin 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 minute

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  no

This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. \ *Break enchantment*\ can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  or \ *stone to flesh*\ , \ *break enchantment*\ works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. 

If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, \ *break enchantment*\ does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.
