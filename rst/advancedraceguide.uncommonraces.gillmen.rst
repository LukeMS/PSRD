Gillmen
########

Gillmen are the remnants of a race of surface-dwelling humanoids whose homeland was drowned in a great cataclysm at the hands of the aboleth. The aboleths rescued a few survivors, warping them into an amphibious race to serve as emissaries to the surface world. Modern gillmen remain reclusive and suspicious, scarred by both the loss of their ancient heritage and the sure knowledge that aboleths do nothing without expecting to profit from it. Physically gillmen have expressive brows, pale skin, dark hair, and bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each side of their necks, near the shoulder, but they are otherwise close enough in appearance to humans that they can pass as such (for a time) without fear of detection.

Alternate Racial Traits
########################

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing gillman racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.gillmen#riverfolk`:

\ **Riverfolk**\ : Some gillmen groups live in colonies along vast riverways, and have adapted to living on land for much longer periods. Gillmen with this trait have a thin coating of natural oil that keeps their skin from cracking even without water.

\ **Slimehunter**\ : Gillmen with this trait are from lineages that have fought against aboleths since the aberrations rescued their human ancestors.

Gillmen with this racial trait do not have the amphibious trait, have the human subtype instead of the aquatic subtype, have no swim speed or bonuses to the :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  skill, cannot breathe water, and do not have the water dependent racial trait.

The following options are available to gillmen. At the GM's discretion, other appropriate races may make use of these as well.

Gillman Equipment
******************

Gillmen have access to the following equipment.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.gillmen#sea_knife`:

\ **Sea-Knife**\ : A sea-knife is a long-handled weapon with a short blade. It is designed to be strapped to the ankle or foot of the wielder, pointing downward and jutting out beyond the wearer's leg. Donning or removing a sea-knife is a full-round action. The wearer cannot use a leg with a sea-knife strapped to it for walking or running. A sea-knife can be used as a light melee weapon when the wielder is swimming, flying, or prone. This allows the wielder to use a two-handed weapon, or wield a weapon with one hand and carry a shield, and still make off-hand attacks with the sea-knife. Attacks made with a sea-knife take a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls in addition to all other attack penalties.
