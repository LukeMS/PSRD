Special Abilities
==================

\ **Buoyant (Ex)**\ A tortoise that fails a :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  check by 5 or more does not sink.

\ **Shell (Ex)**\ As a move action, a tortoise can pull its extremities and head into its shell. It can't move or attack as long as it remains in this state, but its armor bonus from natural armor increases by 4 as long as it does. It may end this state as a move action.

\ **Slow and Steady (Ex)**\  A tortoise's speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance.

Giant tortoises typically live on tropical islands without large predators. Despite their impressive shells, their slow speed makes them easy prey, especially for vermin and other creatures that consume their eggs. Tortoises are herbivores, and can survive for months or even years without food or water. Despite being poor swimmers, their buoyancy and long necks capable mean they can survive for significant periods at sea.

A typical giant tortoise is 3-1/2 feet tall to the top of the shell and weighs 500 pounds.
