Special Abilities
==================
\ **Keen Scent (Ex)**\  A shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.
The shark is a relentless eating machine, a creature evolved over the course of eons to do one job perfectly—hunting. Sharks have achieved a special place in the lore of most seafaring races, who view them as devils, monsters, and the wrath of the gods.
The shark presented here is a 10-foot-long, 300-pound blue shark. Smaller sharks exist, although these are not dangerous. The same cannot be said of larger sharks, such as the following (you can create stats for these sharks by applying the indicated simple templates). 
\ **Hammerhead Shark (CR 3)**\ : This shark has a distinctive hammer-shaped head. It is an advanced shark.
\ **Tiger Shark (CR 3)**\ : Larger than the average shark, the ravenous tiger shark is a giant shark.
\ **Great White Shark (CR 4)**\ : One of the most notorious maneaters of the sea, the truly immense great white shark is an advanced giant shark.

The true nightmare of the sea is the megalodon, a shark that represents the pinnacle of this species' evolution. Horrifying in its immense size and ruinous appetite, the megalodon is certainly the beast behind many legends of enormous fish who swallow ships whole. A megalodon is 60 feet long and weighs 100,000 pounds.
