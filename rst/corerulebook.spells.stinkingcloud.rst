\ *Stinking cloud*\ creates a bank of fog like that created by :ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ , except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become :ref:`nauseated <corerulebook.glossary#nauseated>`\ . This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each :ref:`nauseated <corerulebook.glossary#nauseated>`\  character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.

\ *Stinking cloud*\ can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell. A permanent \ *stinking cloud*\ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
