Enervation
===========

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Effect**\  ray of negative energy

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  (see :ref:`Special Abilities <corerulebook.glossary#appendix_1_special_abilities>`\ ). :ref:`Negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  stack.

Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  have a chance of becoming permanent, but the :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  from \ *enervation*\ don't last long enough to do so.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 Ã— 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
