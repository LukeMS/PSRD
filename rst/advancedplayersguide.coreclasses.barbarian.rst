Barbarian
**********

The true barbarian is a creature of bestial, savage fury. Whether a stoic tribal champion who whips herself into a berserker frenzy for the good of her sword-sisters, or a chaotic warrior who revels in carnage for its own sake, all barbarians share a similar approach to combat. Once the red haze of bloodlust descends, there is only a burning rage that carries them through the screaming fray, heedless of wounds and leaving scattered corpses in their wake.

Presented below are a number of new rage powers to help you customize your barbarian, as well as several classic barbarian archetypes to help you in building your character, each one including a number of suggested rage powers that, while not mandatory, work to flesh out the character concept. Rage powers marked with an asterisk ( \*) can be found in the \ *PRD Core Rulebook*\ .

If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.
