Special Abilities
==================

\ **Ambush Attack (Ex)**\  If a plesiosaurus successfully hits a foe with its bite attack in the surprise round, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of damage and threatens a critical hit on an 18-20. The additional damage from the ambush attack itself is precision damage and is not multiplied on a successful critical hit.

While not technically a dinosaur, the plesiosaurus is often found in waterways and swamps where dinosaurs and other megafauna are common. Long-necked and swift, these ambush predators prefer to dart in, bite a foe, and then swim away to hide while they wait for their victim to bleed out before swimming back to feed. Numerous species of this creature exist, from marsh-dwelling varieties to creatures that spend their entire lives at sea.

A plesiosaurus measures 11 feet long, though nearly half of this length is neck, and weighs 1,000 pounds.

Ecology
========

\ **Environment**\  warm plains

\ **Organization**\  solitary, pair, or flock (3-8)

\ **Treasure**\  none

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Sprint (Ex)**\  Once per hour, a therizinosaurus can move at 10 times its normal speed (400 feet) when it makes a charge.

\ **Sweeping Strike (Ex)**\  As a full-round action, a therizinosaurus can hunker down and make a great, sweeping attack with its claws against up to four adjacent foes. The dinosaur makes an attack roll against each target, inflicting claw damage on a successful hit.

\ **Vicious Claws (Ex)**\  A therizinosaurus's claws threaten a critical hit on an 18-20.

At first glance, this dinosaur's massive claws may well convince observers that it is a predator, but the therizinosaurus is in fact an omnivore. Nonetheless, the therizinosaurus has a foul temper and is both easily angered and difficult to spook. With its deep-cutting claws, the therizinosaurus is more than a match for even the mightiest of predatory dinosaurs. A therizinosaurus is 35 feet long and weighs 13,000 pounds.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Easily Trained (Ex)**\  A troodon is unusually quick to pick up tricks and animal training. All Handle Animal checks made to train a troodon gain a +2 bonus. A troodon can learn an additional 2 tricks beyond what an animal of its intelligence can normally be taught.

The swift, curious troodons are unusually quick to learn, and some can even mimic human speech in the manner of a parrot.

A troodon is 3 feet tall and just over 6 feet long from nose to tail. It weighs 50 pounds.
