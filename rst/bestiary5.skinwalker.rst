Special Abilities
==================

\ **Change Shape (Su)**\  A skinwalker can change shape to a bestial form as a standard action. In bestial form, a skinwalker gains a +2 racial bonus to his choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. While in this form, a skinwalker also takes on an animalistic feature that provides a special effect. Each time a skinwalker assumes bestial form, he can choose to gain two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage, 60 foot darkvision, or a +1 natural armor bonus. These benefits last until the skinwalker returns to his humanoid form as a swift action. A skinwalker must first return to his humanoid form before changing to bestial form again to change benefits. The skinwalker presented here is currently in bestial form, and has claw attacks and a +2 racial bonus to Strength.

Most people believe that skinwalkers are half-breeds of lycanthropes, or that they possess a weaker version of the curse of lycanthropy. However, skinwalker shamans claim that their people were chosen by the gods as a bridge between humanity and animals. Either way, skinwalkers resemble humans much of the time, but they have the uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids with powerful and fearsome aspects of animals.

Skinwalker Characters
**********************

Skinwalkers are defined by class levels—they don't possess racial Hit Dice. Skinwalkers have the following racial traits.

\ **+2 Wisdom, -2 Intelligence, +2 to One Physical Ability Score While in Bestial Form**\ : Skinwalkers are attuned to the natural order and value passion above reason. Their bestial forms strengthen their bodies in various ways.

\ **Medium**\ : Skinwalkers are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

\ **Normal Speed**\ : Skinwalkers have a based speed of 30 feet.

\ **Low-Light Vision**\ : Skinwalkers can see twice as far as humans can in dim light.

\ **Spell-Like Ability**\ : A skinwalker with a Wisdom score of 11 or higher can use :ref:`speak with animals <corerulebook.spells.speakwithanimals#speak_with_animals>`\  once per day as a spell-like ability, using his Wisdom modifier to determine his concentration checks. The caster level for this ability is equal to the skinwalker's character level.

\ **Animal-Minded**\ : Skinwalkers have a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks and on wild empathy checks.

\ **Change Shape**\ : See above.

\ **Languages**\ : Skinwalkers all begin play speaking Common. Skinwalkers with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).
