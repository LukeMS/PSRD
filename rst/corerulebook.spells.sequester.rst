The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by \ *sequester*\ become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.

\ *Note*\ : The :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save prevents an attended or magical object from being \ *sequestered.*\ There is no save to see the \ *sequestered*\ creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.
