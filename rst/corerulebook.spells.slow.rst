An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are :ref:`staggered <corerulebook.glossary#staggered>`\  and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\ , and :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  saves. A \ *slowed*\ creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple \ *slow*\ effects don't stack. \ *Slow*\ counters and dispels :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\ .
