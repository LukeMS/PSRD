Robot
******

Products of advanced scientific technology, the constructs called robots are animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. Most people refer to robots as "automatons" or "metal men"; their proper nomenclature is known to only a few. Unlike most constructs, robots are capable of independent thought. However, they still must obey the programming instilled in them at their creation. Any robot whose creator hard-coded limitations into its programming can never be truly autonomous.

Robots almost always arise from cultures that possess technology that is leaps and bounds ahead of other civilizations, though sometimes they appear due to cultural diffusion from such a society. A wrecked spacecraft, a portal through time, or a group of robots mass-producing others of their kind could all bring robots into a world. Robots that appear from another place or time might still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, or could run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Whatever the case, these robots possess technology that is beyond the means of almost anyone to reproduce, and they represent a stark contrast to other constructs, as they have nothing to do with magic.

Some spellcasters, despite lacking any real grasp on the technological principles required to create robots, have managed to create their own robots by cobbling together spare parts and broken machines, filling in the gaps and completing the design with a mixture of magic and barely understood fragments of science. These inferior designs usually lack the inexhaustible power supplies, advanced intellects, and self-repair systems found in the original robots, and the magic used in their creation can potentially render them more susceptible to techniques that work against other sorts of constructs.

Robots serve a wide range of purposes, from warfare and defense to peaceful tasks like excavation, farming, and maintenance. Small villages that find robots and somehow manage to command them will often put them to work quietly tending fields or constructing buildings all day long. Armies and warlords collect the more dangerous varieties of robots, but even the more ordinary varieties can be deadly. Most robots sport alloyed skin as hard as steel, meaning that even the lowliest worker robot presents a potent threat when altered for battle. Furthermore, since most cultures lack a means to reliably repair or understand how to command robots, even the most benign one might malfunction, or even reach a point in its programming where it changes its activity and refuses to follow orders, leading to untold death and destruction among the its former temporary masters.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, which can be a source of endless frustration for any who seek to control them. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others only yield to the command of technological brooches or control rods. Still others submit after mechanical surgery or rebuilding, or not at all. Many must be given extremely precise instructions, for they are unable to process metaphors or other figures of speech, and may interpret them in unanticipated ways, much to the chagrin of those who would command them. A surprisingly large proportion of uncontrolled robots already speak Common, as most models exhibit considerable linguistics talent, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Though they comprehend language, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgements of orders. Their speech typically excludes words they deem unnecessary with their mechanical efficiency, leading to strange disjointed statements that convey the requisite information without emotion, although some robots programmed to interact well with humans are able to speak in a more fluid and less disconcerting manner.

Constructing a robot requires no magic, but does involve advanced and extraordinarily rare materials and technological expertise. Because almost no one possesses the skills and materials to complete the process of constructing a robot, these entries omit the construction sections provided for most constructs. A GM can add the robot subtype to a different type of construct, such as an animated object or homunculus, to create new types of robots. Typically, this doesn't alter the construct's CR. A character can't create a robot from or add the :ref:`robot subtype <bestiary.creaturetypes#robot_subtype>`\  to a construct that has already been created; adding the :ref:`robot subtype <bestiary.creaturetypes#robot_subtype>`\  to an existing creature is purely a means for the GM to simulate additional robots beyond those provided here.

Other Robots
*************

In addition to the four robots with full entries on the following pages, robots are designed by beings of sufficiently advanced technology for a variety of other tasks. Here is a list of some other robot types and their common uses.

* Collectors serve as scouts and acquisition agents.

* Directors enforce order and maximize efficiency.

* Evaluators determine whether races are fit for contact with other beings.

* Juggernauts are titanic robots with the ability to shut down technology.

* Observers are designed for reconnaissance.

* Reclamators are adept at salvage and construction.

* Surgeons are equipped to treat injuries.

* Thought harvesters extract memories from living creatures.

* Wardens serve as guardians.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Booster Jets (Ex)**\  As a swift action up to 10 times per hour, an annihilator can gain a fly speed of 60 feet (poor maneuverability) for a duration of 1 minute.

\ **Chain Guns (Ex)**\  These advanced firearms have a range increment of 200 feet, automatically reload, and never misfire. An annihilator's core can process scrap metal into new ammunition, effectively giving the annihilator infinite ammunition with these weapons.

\ **Plasma Lance (Ex)**\  As a standard action once every 3 rounds, an annihilator can fire a 120-foot-long line of plasma from its tail. All creatures in this area take 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half). Half of this damage is fire and half is electricity. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

\ **Suppressing Fire (Ex)**\  As a standard action, an annihilator can use its chain guns to fire in a 100-foot cone. When it does so, it makes a single chain gun attack against every target in this area.

The enormous and formidable annihilator robots roam old ruins and wastelands, ridding them of all life and civilization. They smash structures, slaughter creatures both sentient and bestial, and scorch plant life to ashes. When rampaging, an annihilator indiscriminately destroys rather than following the meticulous approach many other robots take with their work. Despite the destruction they wreak, annihilators often gather up those who survive their assaults, collecting the dying and unconscious from battlefields and bringing them to a set location. Their purpose for keeping these battered but still-living prisoners is unknown.

========

\ **Environment**\  any

\ **Organization**\  solitary, pair, or squad (3-12)

\ **Treasure**\  standard (masterwork spear, other treasure)

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Adaptive Learning (Ex)**\  A gearsman has a number of skill points equal to 4 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die, and treats Craft and Profession as class skills. In addition, a gearsman has a number of bonus skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice that can be reprogrammed to apply to any one skill—these ranks can't be split among multiple skills and must apply to one skill. A gearsman can change what skill these bonus ranks apply to up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during which time it can take no other actions. Rather than spend these bonus ranks on a skill, a gearsman can choose to devote them to weapon knowledge, gaining proficiency with a single weapon instead of bonus ranks in a skill. All gearsmen are automatically proficient with all simple weapons.

\ **Charge Weapon (Ex)**\  Any metal weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with electricity and deals 1d6 additional points of electricity damage on a hit.

\ **Nanite Repair (Ex)**\  A gearsman's nanites heal it, restoring a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice every hour (4 hit points per hour for most gearsmen). Once per day, as a full-round action, a gearsman can heal itself or any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage.

For reasons known only to themselves, gearsmen willingly serve as shock troops and guards, performing their tasks with mechanical detachment and coldly logical efficiency. Yet they serve a purpose beyond their current directives—an objective installed in them when they were first created. Gearsmen disobey their putative masters whenever an order contradicts these mysterious internal directives. When questioned about their lapses, gearsmen answer with only silence.

Despite their construction, gearsmen move fluidly. Their lack of a functional mouth doesn't prevent them from talking, though most speak rarely. When they do talk, they speak with shrill, oddly distorted speech devoid of emotion and nuance, and their voices are all eerily alike.

========

\ **Environment**\  any

\ **Organization**\  solitary or unit (2-6)

\ **Treasure**\  none

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Laser Rifle (Ex)**\  A myrmidon's eye is an integrated laser rifle with a range increment of 250 feet.

\ **Quantum Lash (Ex)**\  A myrmidon's two facial tentacles lash out with surprising force, and are capable of extending up to a reach of 20 feet. These lashes are primary attacks that deal force damage on a hit. They resolve as touch attacks, but the damage dealt is not modified by Strength, nor can it be improved by :ref:`Power Attack <corerulebook.feats#power_attack>`\ . A quantum lash threatens a critical hit on a natural 19-20. A quantum lash that strikes a force field or force effect has a chance to disrupt that effect. Against a magical force effect like a :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`\ , the myrmidon makes a special check as if it were casting :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  against the effect (CL 11th). Against a robot's force field, the robot struck must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or its force field deactivates for 1d10 rounds, after which time the robot reactivates at the same hit point total it was at before it was deactivated. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

\ **Resilient (Ex)**\  Myrmidons receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.

\ **Rockets (Ex)**\  As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket to a range of 800 feet. A rocket explodes on impact in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage and 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex DC 18 half). A myrmidon carries a maximum of five rockets. It can replenish fired rockets at the rate of one per 12 hours, crafting new rockets from scrap metal and other collected components. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

\ **Superior Optics (Ex)**\  Myrmidons see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.

Myrmidons are highly mobile robots programmed to patrol the skies above important locations. They react with swift violence, interpret anomalous sensory input as proof of hostile intent and rain destruction on the offending target immediately and without mercy. Most have been programmed to communicate, but they rarely hesitate in their carnage to do so.

\ **Reprogram Terrain (Ex)**\  Three times per day as an action that takes 1 full round, a terraformer can release a cloud of nanites that mimics the effects of one of the following spells, using the terraformer's Hit Dice as the caster level: :ref:`expeditious excavation <advancedplayersguide.spells.expeditiousexcavation#expeditious_excavation>`\ , :ref:`soften earth and stone <corerulebook.spells.softenearthandstone#soften_earth_and_stone>`\ , or :ref:`stone shape <corerulebook.spells.stoneshape#stone_shape>`\ .

\ **Terraform (Ex)**\  Ten terraformers working in tandem can create remarkable effects over long periods of time, causing permanent changes to the local environment. The robots must maintain line of effect to each other, and each must be within 1 mile of one other terraformer. If they do this for a period of at least 2 weeks, one of the following effects (robots' choice) occurs in a 1-mile radius: the terrain is shaped as per :ref:`move earth <corerulebook.spells.moveearth#move_earth>`\ ; water in the area is altered as per :ref:`control water <corerulebook.spells.controlwater#control_water>`\ ; plants in the area are affected as per either :ref:`plant growth <corerulebook.spells.plantgrowth#plant_growth>`\  or :ref:`diminish plants <corerulebook.spells.diminishplants#diminish_plants>`\ ; or the average temperature in the area is raised or lowered by 10° Fahrenheit.

\ **Technological Wonders (Ex)**\  Effects from a terraformer's abilities are nonmagical in nature, and can't be identified, dispelled, or affected by effects that can affect only spells. The duration of these effects never expires.

Terraformer robots are sent to planets to pave the way for military bases, trading outposts, or settlements. A planet designated as a waystation might require only a few robots, but those marked for permanent habitation might have their skies darkened by hordes of terraformers, forming a hovering lattice around the globe.
