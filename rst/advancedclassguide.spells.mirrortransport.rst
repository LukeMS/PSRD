Mirror Transport
=================

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a glass or metal marble and a twisted loop of parchment)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one mirror

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  yes (object); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (object)

This spell functions as :ref:`mirror hideaway <advancedclassguide.spells.mirrorhideaway>`\ , except any creature that enters the target mirror can spend a swift action to exit through another mirror within 500 feet as if using :ref:`dimension door <corerulebook.spells.dimensiondoor#dimension_door>`\ ; this is a one-way transport. The creature can exit through a mirror only if it could fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. Each transport through the target mirror reduces the spell's duration by 1 hour.
