Limited Wish

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 standard action

\ **Components**\ V, S, M (diamond worth 1,500 gp)

\ **Range**\ see text

A \ *limited wish*\ lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a \ *limited wish*\ can do any of the following things.

*  Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.

*  Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.

*  Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.

*  Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. 

*  Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as \ *geas/quest*\  or :ref:`insanity <corerulebook.spells.insanity#insanity>`\ .

*  Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a â€“7 penalty on its next saving throw.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a \ *limited wish*\ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).
