Beast Shape (all)
==================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`beast shape <corerulebook.spells.beastshape>`

Each \ *mythic beast shape*\  spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic \ *beast shape*\  spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level \ *mythic beast shape*\  spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn \ *mythic beast shape II*\ if you know :ref:`beast shape II <corerulebook.spells.beastshape#beast_shape_ii>`\ , even if you don't know \ *mythic beast shape I*\ ). Each \ *mythic beast shape*\  spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.

The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum Ã—4).

\ **Augmented (2nd)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the :ref:`Natural Spell <corerulebook.feats#natural_spell>`\  feat for 1 round. For example, if you're 2nd tier, you can use the :ref:`Natural Spell <corerulebook.feats#natural_spell>`\  feat for 2 rounds per casting of \ *mythic beast shape*\ .
