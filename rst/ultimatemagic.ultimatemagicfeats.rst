Feats
******

Feats represent special tricks or abilities a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his or her birth. They grant characters abilities that others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some feats specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most can be taken by anyone who meets the prerequisites.

Types of Feats
###############

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#combat_feats`:

Combat Feats
*************

Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming they meet the prerequisites.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#critical_feats`:

Critical Feats
***************

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an additional condition on the victim of the critical hit. Characters without the :ref:`Critical Mastery <corerulebook.feats#critical_mastery>`\  feat can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide which feat to apply after the critical hit has been confirmed.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#metamagic_feats`:

Metamagic Feats
****************

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells, reference the :ref:`Metamagic Feats introduction <corerulebook.feats#metamagic_feats>`\ .

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#teamwork_feats`:

Teamwork Feats
***************

Teamwork feats grant large bonuses, but they only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally who also possesses the feat to be positioned carefully on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even when their allies don't have the feats.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#accursed_critical`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#accursed_critical_(critical)`_

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#accursed_critical_(critical)`:

This works even with ranged spells. You must have :ref:`bestow curse <corerulebook.spells.bestowcurse#bestow_curse>`\  or :ref:`major curse <ultimatemagic.spells.curse#curse_major>`\  prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#accursed_hex`:

Accursed Hex
*************

You can make a second attempt at failed hexes.

\ **Prerequisite:**\  Hex class feature.

\ **Benefit:**\  When you target a creature with a hex that cannot target the same creature more than once per day, and that creature succeeds at its saving throw against the hex's effect, you can target the creature with the same hex a second time before the end of your next turn. If the second attempt fails, you can make no further attempts to target that creature with the same hex for 1 day. 

\ **Normal:**\  You can only target a creature with these hexes once per day.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#advanced_ranger_trap`:

*********************

Your ranger traps are especially difficult to notice and avoid.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Trap class feature, ranger level 5th.

\ **Benefit:**\  Add +1 to the Difficulty Class on all :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  and :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  skill checks to find or disable the traps you make with your trap class feature. Add a +1 to the Difficulty Class on all saving throws against the effects of the trap you make with your trap class feature. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#antagonize`:

Antagonize
***********

Whether with biting remarks or hurtful words, you are adept at making creatures angry with you.

\ **Benefit:**\  You can make :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  and :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  checks to make creatures respond to you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to 10+ the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. You cannot make this check against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. Before you make these checks, you may make a :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check (DC 20) as a swift action to gain an insight bonus on these :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  or Intimitade checks equal to your Charisma bonus until the end of your next turn. The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#diplomacy`:

 :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ : You fluster your enemy. For the next minute, the target takes a –2 penalty on all attacks rolls made against creatures other than you and has a 10% spell failure chance on all spells that do not target you or that have you within their area of effect.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#intimidate`:

 :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\ : The creature flies into a rage. On its next turn, the target must attempt to make a melee attack against you, make a ranged attack against you, target you with a spell, or include you in the area of a spell. The effect ends if the creature is prevented from attacking you or attempting to do so would harm it (for example, if you are on the other side of a chasm or a :ref:`wall of fire <corerulebook.spells.walloffire#wall_of_fire>`\ ). If it cannot attack you on its turn, you may make the check again as an immediate action to extend the effect for 1 round (but cannot extend it thereafter). The effect ends as soon as the creature attacks you. Once you have targeted a creature with this ability, you cannot target it again for 1 day.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#blighted_critical`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#blighted_critical_(critical)`_

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#blighted_critical_(critical)`:

Blighted Critical (Critical)
*****************************

With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Caster level 5th.

\ **Benefit:**\  Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a touch spell, ranged touch spell, or spell-like ability against an opponent, the victim gains a random minor spellblight (see page 95).

\ **Special:**\  You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess :ref:`Critical Mastery <corerulebook.feats#critical_mastery>`\ .

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#blighted_critical_mastery`:

Blighted Critical Mastery
**************************

You control the type of spellblight your critical hits give your opponent. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Blighted Critical <ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#blighted_critical>`\ , caster level 9th.

\ **Benefit:**\  Whenever you apply a spellblight by way of the :ref:`Blighted Critical <ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#blighted_critical>`\  or Greater Blighted critical feat, you can choose the spellblight you apply rather than determining it randomly.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#burning_spell`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#burning_spell_(metamagic)`_

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#burning_spell_(metamagic)`:

Burning Spell (Metamagic)
**************************

You cause creatures to take extra damage when you affect them with a spell that has the acid or fire descriptor. 

\ **Benefit:**\  The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2× the spell's actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell's descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect. A burning spell uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#channeled_shield_wall`:

Channeled Shield Wall
**********************

You draw upon your channel energy to enhance the protective ability of your shield and those of allies while they are adjacent to you.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Channel energy, 3d6 proficiency with a shield.

\ **Benefit:**\  As a swift action, you can spend a use of your channel energy to grant yourself a +2 deflection bonus while using a shield. This bonus lasts 1 minute per cleric level or effective cleric level. While you benefit from this bonus, allies with shields also gain a +2 deflection bonus while they are adjacent to you.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#concussive_spell`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#concussive_spell_(metamagic)`_

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#concussive_spell_(metamagic)`:

Concussive Spell (Metamagic)
*****************************

You cause creatures to be disoriented when you affect them with a spell that has the sonic descriptor. 

\ **Benefit:**\  With sonic damage comes a concussive wave of energy that rattles creatures affected by the spell. A concussive spell causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A concussive spell only affects spells with the sonic descriptor. A concussive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#create_reliquary_arms_and_shields`:

Create Reliquary Arms and Shields
**********************************

Your magical creations are infused with divine power.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , ability to cast :ref:`consecrate <corerulebook.spells.consecrate#consecrate>`\  or :ref:`desecrate <corerulebook.spells.desecrate#desecrate>`\ .

\ **Benefit:**\  When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you may add one casting of :ref:`consecrate <corerulebook.spells.consecrate#consecrate>`\  or :ref:`desecrate <corerulebook.spells.desecrate#desecrate>`\  as part of the item crafting process. This increases the item's price by 250 gp. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast :ref:`consecrate <corerulebook.spells.consecrate#consecrate>`\  or :ref:`desecrate <corerulebook.spells.desecrate#desecrate>`\ , your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#create_sanguine_elixir`:

Create Sanguine Elixir
***********************

You can condense a fraction of your bloodline's power into a powerful elixir. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Cha 15, :ref:`Brew Potion <corerulebook.feats#brew_potion>`\ , :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) 12 ranks, sorcerer level 3rd. 

\ **Benefit:**\  Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. 

 When a creature drinks a sanguine elixir, it can activate the bloodline power anytime before the end of its next turn, as if it had access to that bloodline power. A creature that drinks the elixir cannot gain the benefit if its character level does not equal or exceed the minimum level of the bloodline power. Any level-dependent effects use the character level of the creature that drinks the sanguine elixir, or your sorcerer level, whichever is lower. Drinking a sanguine elixir is just like drinking a potion. A sanguine elixir is treated as a magic item with your caster level.

 Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#defending_eidolon`:

Defending Eidolon
******************

You have trained your eidolon to protect you. 

\ **Prerequisite:**\  Shield ally feature.

\ **Benefit:**\  Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a –1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by –1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your eidolon's next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the eidolon, whichever occurs first.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#deny_death`:

Deny Death
***********

Your \ *ki*\  is so strong that it can deny death.

\ **Prerequisite:**\  \ *Ki*\  pool, :ref:`Endurance <corerulebook.feats#endurance>`

\ **Benefit:**\  As long as you have 1 \ *ki*\  point in your ki pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 2d6 hit points of damage instead.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#detect_expertise`:

Detect Expertise
*****************

You can detect the mystic specialty of a foe.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Int 13; ability to cast :ref:`detect chaos <corerulebook.spells.detectchaos#detect_chaos>`\ , :ref:`detect evil <corerulebook.spells.detectevil#detect_evil>`\ , :ref:`detect good <corerulebook.spells.detectgood#detect_good>`\ , :ref:`detect law <corerulebook.spells.detectlaw#detect_law>`\ , or :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\ .

\ **Benefit:**\  When you use any of the spells listed in this feat's prerequisites to detect a creature's alignment or its magic, you have a chance of detecting what spellcasting expertise it has. After you observe a creature with the detect spell for 3 rounds, it must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier). If it fails the saving throw, you learn what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#die_for_your_master`:

Die for Your Master
********************

Your tumor familiar goes to any length to save your life.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Tumor familiar alchemist discovery. 

\ **Benefit:**\  If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate action. If it makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack; if it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage.

 The familiar must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability, and it can only do this once per day—if it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow the familiar to make a Reflex save for half damage, its improved evasion ability does not apply on this saving throw.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#divine_interference`:

Divine Interference
********************

You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy's attack. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Divine spellcaster, caster level 10th.

\ **Benefit:**\  As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can sacrifice a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you sacrifice. You must sacrifice a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#dragonbane_aura`:

Dragonbane Aura
****************

Those within your dragonbane aura gain the same protection that you do. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Aura of courage class feature, caster level 8th.

\ **Benefit:**\  When fighting dragons, your aura of courage expands to a 20-foot-radius emanation, and allies in the aura gain a morale bonus on saving throws against dragon breath equal to your aura of courage's bonus against fear effects.

\ **Normal:**\  The aura of courage is a 10-foot-radius emanation, and grants a +4 morale bonus on fear effects.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#echoing_spell`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#echoing_spell_(metamagic)`_

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#echoing_spell_(metamagic)`:

Echoing Spell (Metamagic)
**************************

You have learned how to release most, but not all, of a spell's potential when you cast it. 

\ **Benefit:**\  When you cast an echoing spell, it does not disappear entirely from memory, and you can cast it one additional time during that day. No effect that allows you to reprepare or recast a spell can affect the echoed spell. If you prepare spells, this second casting does not require you to prepare it in another spell slot. If you spontaneously cast spells, this second casting does not expend another available spell slot. An echoing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#eldritch_heritage`:

Eldritch Heritage
******************

You are descended from a long line of sorcerers, and some portion of their power flows in your veins.

You must have Skill focus in the class skill that bloodline grants to a sorcerer at 1st level (for example, :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  for the celestial bloodline). This bloodline cannot be a bloodline you already have. You gain the first-level bloodline power for the selected bloodline. For purposes of using that power, treat your sorcerer level as equal to your character level – 2, even if you have levels in sorcerer. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#ensemble`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#ensemble_(teamwork)`_

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#ensemble_(teamwork)`:

Ensemble (Teamwork)
********************

You can create an ensemble of skilled and amateur performers to aid you in your performance.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  5 ranks

\ **Benefit:**\  When you are performing, allies within 20 feet who also have this feat can aid you with your :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  checks (including those made as part of bardic performance) as if they were aiding another as an immediate action. The allies make their aid another rolls before you make your check. No more than four allies can grant you a bonus with aid another. Allies aiding you do not need to use the same category of the :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  skill that you are using in order to aid you. 

\ **Special:**\  If you possess one or more levels of the bard class, you can choose any one ally within 20 feet to be part of the ensemble. The ally is considered to have the ensemble teamwork feat for the purposes of aiding your performance.

\ **Benefit:**\  When you cast a bard spell that deals damage, you may replace the spell's normal damage with fire damage or split the spell's damage so that half of it is the normal damage type and half is fire damage.

 If you cast a :ref:`summon monster <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.summoner#summon_monster_i>`\  spell as a bard spell,  you may choose to give the summoned creature a fiery appearance, which gives it fire resistance 5 and adds +1 fire damage to all of its natural attacks. The creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. This aspect of the feat has no effect if the creature already has the fire subtype.

 When you use this feat, the affected spell gains the fire descriptor.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#flaring_spell`: `ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#flaring_spell_(metamagic)`_

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Cha 13, lay on hands class feature, mercy class feature.

\ **Benefit:**\  When you use your lay on hands ability and the target of that ability does not have any conditions your mercies can remove, it instead heals an additional +1d6 points of damage.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#greater_spell_specialization`:

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#greater_wild_empathy`:

Greater Wild Empathy

\ **Benefit:**\  You gain a +2 insight bonus on wild empathy checks, and you may use wild empathy to duplicate an :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  check rather than a :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  check.

You may influence creatures of that type with wild empathy, if their Intelligence score is 1 or 2, or they do not possess an Intelligence score. Once you choose the type of creature, it cannot be changed.

\ **Special:**\  You may select this feat more than once. Each time, you may choose an additional creature type to influence.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#implant_bomb`:

Implant Bomb
*************

You can attach a bomb to a creature that explodes when the creature dies or after 24 hours.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  5 ranks, delayed bomb alchemist discovery. 

\ **Benefit:**\  You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.

 If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).

 Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  spell or :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  check to neutralize the bomb (DC = 11 + alchemist's caster level).

\ **Benefit:**\  You can combine your bardic performance and your spellcasting in two ways. 

 First, you can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with a :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  check. Observers must make a :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  or :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check opposed by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of your bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time.

 Second, as a move action, you can use 1 round of bardic performance to maintain a bard spell with a duration of concentration. You can cast another spell in the same round you are using bardic magic to maintain concentration; if you do this, your concentration on the maintained spell ends when you end the bardic performance the spell is part of.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#spontaneous_metafocus`:

Spontaneous Metafocus

You can focus to combine one of your known spells and metamagic feats.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Cha 13, one metamagic feat, able to spontaneously cast spells.

\ **Benefit:**\  Pick a single spell that you are able to cast spontaneously. When you apply metamagic feats to that spell, you can cast the spell using the normal casting time instead of at the slower casting time.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#starlight_summons`:

Starlight Summons
******************

Your summoned minions slink along under the shadows of the stars. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Spell Focus <corerulebook.feats#spell_focus>`\  (conjuration), able to cast \ *summon nature's ally*\ .

\ **Benefit:**\  Creatures you summon gain the :ref:`Blind-Fight <corerulebook.feats#blind_fight>`\  feat, a +5 bonus to :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  and :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks in dim light or darkness, and their natural weapons are treated as cold iron for overcoming damage reduction.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#sunlight_summons`:

Sunlight Summons
*****************

Your summoned minions shine with the power of the sun. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Spell Focus <corerulebook.feats#spell_focus>`\  (conjuration), able to cast \ *summon nature's ally*\ .

\ **Benefit:**\  Creatures that you summon shed light as a :ref:`light <corerulebook.spells.light#light>`\  spell. They are immune to blinding or dazzling effects, and their natural weapons are treated as magical for overcoming damage reduction.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#superior_summoning`:

Superior Summoning
*******************

You can summon more creatures.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Augment Summoning <corerulebook.feats#augment_summoning>`\ , caster level 3rd.

\ **Benefit:**\  Each time you cast a summoning spell that conjures more than one creature, add one to the total number of creatures summoned.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#thanatopic_spell_(metamagic)`:

Thanatopic Spell (Metamagic)
*****************************

Your spells can pierce wards against negative energy and even affect undead targets. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (religion) 6 ranks, :ref:`Spell Focus <corerulebook.feats#spell_focus>`\  (necromancy).

\ **Benefit:**\  A thanatopic spell pierces defenses and immunities that protect against death effects, negative levels, and energy drain, affecting the target as if the protective barrier did not exist.

 For example, you could cast a thanatopic :ref:`vampiric touch <corerulebook.spells.vampirictouch#vampiric_touch>`\  or :ref:`enervation <corerulebook.spells.enervation#enervation>`\  spell on a target under the effects of :ref:`death ward <corerulebook.spells.deathward#death_ward>`\ , and the target would suffer the normal effect of the spell. Saving throws and SR (if any) still apply. 

 Undead are susceptible to spells augmented by this feat, as it retunes the negative energy to be harmful to them. A thanatopic spell that would kill a living creature (such as by giving it negative levels equal to its Hit Dice) destroys an undead (though undead such as ghosts, liches, and vampires may reform as normal). Undead affected by thanatopic spells that give negative levels automatically make their saving throws to remove negative levels after 24 hours. 

 A thanatopic spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. 

\ **Normal:**\  Defenses such as :ref:`death ward <corerulebook.spells.deathward#death_ward>`\  negate death effects, negative levels, and energy drain. Undead are immune to these attacks.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#theurgy`:

Theurgy

You can blend the power of arcane and divine magic.

\ **Benefit:**\  You can augment the power of your divine spells with arcane energy and augment your arcane spells with divine energy.

 When casting a divine spell, you may sacrifice an arcane spell slot or arcane prepared spell of that spell's level or higher as a swift action. The caster level for that divine spell increases by +1.

 When casting an arcane spell, you may sacrifice a divine spell slot or prepared divine spell of the same or higher level as a swift action. Half the damage dealt by the arcane spell becomes holy (if you channel positive energy) or unholy (if you channel negative energy).

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#thoughtful_discernment`:

Thoughtful Discernment
***********************

Thinking back, you discover a lie in what you once thought to be words of truth.

\ **Prerequisite:**\  Discern lies class feature.

\ **Benefit:**\  Once per day as a free action, you can think back about a single statement you heard in the last day and determine if it was a lie. This acts like the :ref:`discern lies <corerulebook.spells.discernlies#discern_lies>`\  spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement a creature has made. 

 For example, if the king told you, "My daughter is in the monster's dungeon" before you left to find her, as long as the king said that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or not the king deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (religion) 6 ranks, :ref:`Spell Focus <corerulebook.feats#spell_focus>`\  (necromancy). 

\ **Benefit:**\  This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A threnodic spell affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures. A threnodic spell uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell's actual level. 

\ **Normal:**\  Undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.

.. _`ultimatemagic.ultimatemagicfeats#toppling_spell_(metamagic)`:

Toppling Spell (Metamagic)
***************************

Your spells with the force descriptor knock the affected creatures prone.

\ **Benefit:**\  The impact of your force spell is strong enough to knock the target prone. If the target takes damage, fails its saving throw, or is moved by your force spell, make a trip check against the target, using your caster level plus your casting ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, Intelligence for wizards, and so on). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check fails, the target cannot attempt to trip you or the force effect in response.

 A toppling spell only affects spells with the force descriptor. A toppling spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

\ **Benefit:**\  As a full-round action, while wielding a quarterstaff two-handed, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against each enemy adjacent to you.

You can focus your ability to detect evil for more practical or mundane purposes

\ **Prerequisite:**\  :ref:`Detect evil <corerulebook.spells.detectevil#detect_evil>`\  class feature.

\ **Benefit:**\  As a swift action, you can focus the clarity granted by your \ *detect evil*\  ability to heighten your awareness of other things. This gives you a +10 sacred bonus on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  and :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks for one round. This expends your use of the \ *detect evil*\  class ability for the next 24 hours.

Versatile Channeler
********************

You can choose to channel positive and negative energy. 

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Channel energy class feature, necromancer or neutrally aligned cleric (see below).

\ **Benefit:**\  You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature.

 If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal.

 If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal.

 Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have "channel positive energy" or "channel negative energy" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the :ref:`Command Undead <corerulebook.feats#command_undead>`\  feat and the :ref:`Turn Undead <corerulebook.feats#turn_undead>`\  feat).

\ **Note:**\  This feat only applies to necromancers, neutral clerics who worship neutral deities, or neutral clerics who do not worship a deity—characters who have the channel energy class ability and have to make a choice to channel positive or negative energy at 1st level. Clerics whose alignment or deity makes this choice for them cannot select this feat.

You speak with the tongue of men and beasts.

\ **Prerequisites:**\  Druid level 6th, wild shape class feature.

\ **Benefit:**\  When using wild shape to take the form in which you cannot speak (such as an animal), you are able to speak normally in any language you know. This allows you to cast spells with verbal components, speak command words, and activate spell completion and spell trigger items.
