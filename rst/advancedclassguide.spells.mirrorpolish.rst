Mirror Polish
==============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a soft cloth)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one metal item of up to 1 sq. ft.

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  yes (object); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (object)

You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a mirror. This spell does not prevent the item from later being affected by damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface. The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail.
