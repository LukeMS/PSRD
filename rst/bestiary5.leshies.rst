Leshy, Flytrap

This cluster of flytraps has a vaguely humanoid shape. The beady eyes atop the largest flytrap glare menacingly.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Amalgam (Ex)**\  Multiple flytrap leshys can combine themselves temporarily into a single creature, to a maximum of 25 leshys. Each leshy beyond the first grants the amalgam 1 Hit Die, and it gains a size category at 9, 12, 18, and 30 Hit Dice. The amalgam has a number of bite attacks equal to the number of bites of all component leshys combined, but only two flytrap hands attacks. If the amalgam drops below 0 hit points, it dissolves, and the damage is divided among the component leshys.

\ **Digest (Ex)**\  A creature that takes acid damage from a flytrap leshy's bites or spittle must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Flytrap Hands (Ex)**\  In addition to the central flytrap that serves as its head, a flytrap leshy has two additional, smaller flytraps that serve as its hands. These hands function as the bite of a Tiny creature.

Most leshys are peaceful creatures that focus their efforts on tending the natural region around them. While flytrap leshys do not leave their homes to pick fights, they relish the opportunity to attack intruders. These carnivorous plants tend to attack before asking questions. While they rarely work together with other creatures, the aggressive creatures eagerly collaborate with others of their kind. They fight best in teams, and coordinate with each other so seamlessly that a group of flytrap leshys is nearly indistinguishable from a single creature—an illusion that the similarity between a flytrap leshy's head and hands only compounds. While a typical flytrap leshy has one head and two hands, more powerful flytrap leshys exist with greater numbers of heads and hands.

Cantankerous flytrap leshys represent the harsh and seemingly cruel aspects of the natural cycle that are ultimately needed for the greater well-being of all creatures. When necessary to protect their homes, flytrap leshys start controlled fires, relying on their fire resistance to wade through the flames.

Unlike most of their kind, flytrap leshys eat flesh and are not picky about the kind of meat that they consume. They particularly savor insects, and one of the few ways to placate a flytrap leshy is to offer it a rare or unusual insect to consume.

A typical flytrap leshy is 2 feet tall and weighs 20 pounds.

Creating a Flytrap Leshy
*************************

A flytrap leshy is usually grown in swampy or marshy terrain. A flytrap leshy will only emerge if it is given a small pile of freshly killed insects to eat.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Aura of Tranquility (Su)**\  A lotus leshy exudes a calming aura within a 20-foot radius, which functions as \ *calm emotions*\  (Will DC 15 negates). A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to that leshy's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Dream Pollen (Ex)**\  A lotus leshy can expel pollen in a 15-foot cone. All creatures within the cone (as well as those who take damage from seed spray) must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or fall asleep for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Seed Spray (Ex)**\  A lotus leshy can shoot several of its seeds at targets within 30 feet. It can shoot up to 6 seeds as a standard action, dividing the seeds as it chooses among targets in range. Each seed deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage. The leshy rolls a single attack roll to determine the accuracy of all of the seeds in the spray. The attack has a Ã3 critical multiplier, and the leshy makes only one roll to confirm a critical threat.

Enigmatic lotus leshys are wise guardians of secluded ponds and lakes. They spend most of their time in meditation as lotus flowers, sometimes for decades at a time. Although lotus leshys spend most of their time floating in solitary reflection, they do not shun the company of other creatures, and take humanoid form whenever they wish to speak. They find discussions of religion and philosophy particularly fascinating, and delight in fresh perspectives. Although they study deities of self-perfection and contemplation extensively, they do not revere such beings.

 Lotus leshys speak indirectly rather than providing specific answers. They maintain that contemplation and discussion are far more valuable than concrete answers, whose usefulness is limited to the question at hand. In addition, they believe those who receive direct answers are more likely to blindly accept the words of others rather than thinking for themselves. When confronted with impatience, lotus leshys return to their lotus form rather than engaging further. They avoid combat whenever possible, preferring to calm tempers with their tranquil auras or lull violent creatures to sleep with their soporific pollen.

A typical lotus leshy stands 3 feet tall, and weighs 15 pounds.

Creating a Lotus Leshy
***********************

Lotus leshys grow best in warm ponds and lakes in quiet areas. To grow a lotus leshy, the maker must plant a lotus seed by the water's edge, and sit in quiet mediation by the seed until it sprouts.
