.. _`npccodex.core.ranger#cullen_theoren`:

Cullen Theoren
===============

Cullen is a savage survivor in an environment that constantly threatens death from exposure, disease or predators. He hunts any creature that intrudes on his territory, and has little tolerance for weakness or mercy.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\ Cullen strikes at the PCs from the water or from an elevated branch, slipping away before they can approach before returning to harass them again and again. He may also try to lure the PCs into environmental threats such as deep water or quicksand to make them easier prey.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  If Cullen observes the PCs navigating his swamp with ease or defeating a dangerous monster, he may offer his services as a guide, or trade information with them.

The pirate queen is a deadly foe, whether she's encountered in a scummy port town or out on the high seas, flying the black flag. She keeps a full crew of unruly, vicious buccaneers in line, and rewards them with the treasure and carnage they crave.

.. _`npccodex.core.ranger#pialoosa`:

Pialoosa
=========

Cocky and self-assured from years of experience on the water, Pialoosa expects nothing but the best from her crew, and rewards them generously when they show great bravery or skill. She is especially greedy—even for a pirate—and pursues any rumors, maps, or historical fables that might lead to treasure hoards hidden by long-dead pirates.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\ Pialoosa pursues a ship the PCs are on, demanding they surrender their treasure or be tossed in the briny deep. If encountered on land, she might start a massive brawl in a tavern, possibly after playing a game of cards and losing a good share of the booty she acquired most recently.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Pialoosa could be hired as a trustworthy (if black-hearted) ship captain to guide the PCs through dangerous waters. She relies on her reputation to keep other pirates away, and flies a special red flag with a black image of a foot on it to indicate she's aboard a ship. Anyone who attacks her ship risks death beneath her blade, even if it's an old friend.

The giant-killer is trained to kill monsters many times her size, using speed, specialized weapons, and time honored techniques to bring down even the most daunting foes.

.. _`npccodex.core.ranger#mirshi_knee_splitter`:

Mirshi Knee-Splitter
=====================

Feisty and fearless, Mirshi is good at slaying giants—and she makes sure that everyone else knows it. If a town is menaced by her favored prey, she swaggers in and demands an outrageous price for her services. Once the townsfolk agree, she murders the giants, claims her wages, and leaves the town impoverished. She's been fighting giants since she came of age, and she wants to collect at least one head from each type of giant to display in her trophy room.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\  Mirshi might attack the PCs to prevent them from stealing her glory or depriving her of a bounty from a nearby village. If giants are involved in a fight, she fights them no matter how much she might despise the other combatants involved. When she misses in combat against a Medium or Small creature, she claims it's because she's so used to fighting much larger opponents (mostly just to protect her pride).

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Mirshi loves it when others laud her achievements. She quickly becomes friendly toward a bard PC if she thinks the bard might write ballads, songs, epic poems, or plays about her giant-slaying adventures. The tales Mirshiri tells about herself are highly exaggerated, but she never lies when counting up the number of giants that she's killed.

.. _`npccodex.core.ranger#alec_renatus`:

Alec Renatus
=============

Alec hunts people to bring them to justice, not because he enjoys killing. He uses deadly force only if he must to protect himself or others. He tries to learn as much as possible about his target before starting his pursuit, and selects potions and other items based on the best tactics for capturing that person.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\ Alec generally does work only for legitimate and lawful governments, but might attempt to capture a PC if he was deceived into believing that PC has broken the law.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Alec could approach the PCs to gain their help in capturing a particularly difficult target.

Elizaveta Oriones
==================

Trained by a church, Elizaveta sees killing demons and devils as a sacred duty. In villages plagued by fiends, she questions locals to determine what kind of threat she faces. If foolish dabblers called the fiends, she turns them in. If the summoning was deliberate, she kills those who were responsible.

\ **Combat Encounters:**\ Eliza might confront the PCs if she hears rumors that one is a conjurer or summoner.

\ **Roleplaying Suggestions:**\  Eliza volunteers her help only if PCs are hunting demons, devils, or fiendish cults.
