Prismatic Sphere
=================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`prismatic sphere <corerulebook.spells.prismaticsphere#prismatic_sphere>`

When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a :ref:`prismatic spray <corerulebook.spells.prismaticspray#prismatic_spray>`\  that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates directly away from you. The save DC of this \ *prismatic spray*\  is the same as that of your \ *mythic prismatic sphere*\ .
