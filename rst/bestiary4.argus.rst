Special Abilities
==================

\ **Absolute Readiness (Ex)**\  An argus is never surprised or flat-footed. It can act in the surprise round as if it were a normal round.

\ **Accurate Strikes (Ex)**\  An argus's attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by any cover less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by any concealment less than total concealment.

\ **Eye Gouge (Ex)**\  If an argus rends or pins an opponent, as a swift action it can attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind the target. If its combat maneuver check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the opponent is permanently blinded.

\ **Fascinating Gaze (Su)**\  A creature within 40 feet of an argus must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or be fascinated for 5d6 rounds. If the creature has 4 or fewer Hit Dice, it is instead dazed for 5d6 rounds. An argus can't use this ability in the same round it uses frightful presence. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Limitless Vision (Ex)**\  An argus takes no distance penalties on :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks.

An argus is an ancient creature related to the titans, transformed by a deity into a vigilant and restless sentry, usually as a punishment for some affront or rebellion. Within its hideous and misshapen body lies a lonely heart that craves music and beauty to comfort it in its forlorn and unending vigil. It might talk peaceably with visitors if they promise to sing songs or tell stories (and it believes its guests don't intend to harm it or steal what it guards). If insulted or mocked, an argus is quick to anger, dispatching foes so it can go back to brooding in peace.

An argus stands 25 feet tall and weighs 18,000 pounds.
