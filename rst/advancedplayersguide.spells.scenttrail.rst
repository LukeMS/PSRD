You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that only the creatures you designate at the time of casting can detect. These creatures find it very easy to follow this trail. They gain a +20 competence bonus on any :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  checks made for the purpose of tracking the creature laying this trail. Subject creatures with the scent special ability gain a +10 competence bonus on Wisdom or :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  checks to follow the trail.

In addition, you can leave scent messages along the trail. Each word or emotion in this message requires spending a move action in the same spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this message must make another DC 20 :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  check, with a â€“1 penalty for every word or emotion in the message, in order to understand it. Creatures cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot use, or do not have, a sense of smell. Creatures can use this spell to backtrack through a dungeon, maze, or similar areas even if the creature laying down the trail crossed over the spot multiple times.
