Blood caterpillars are among the largest of giant caterpillars. These massive vermin draw sustenance from rotting meat in the same way many butterflies eat rotting fruit. Behind their mandibles are spinnerets that allow them to manipulate silk, which the caterpillars can discharge to spin webs and immobilize their prey. Their venom weakens the muscles of creatures exposed to it, aiding the caterpillars in restraining and devouring even large, strong, and agile prey.

Unlike normal caterpillars, voracious giant horn caterpillars don't pupate into butterflies. Instead, they remain in their worm-like forms for their entire life cycle, growing between each molt until they eventually reach the size of large dogs.

Horn caterpillars feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates, which they usually scavenge from corpses. Their sharp mandibles allow them to effortlessly shear through tendon and bone.
