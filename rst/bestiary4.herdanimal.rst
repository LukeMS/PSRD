Special Abilities
==================

\ **Natural Weapons (Ex)**\  A giraffe's hoof attacks are primary attacks and its slam attack is a secondary attack.

These long-necked animals roam across plains in loose-knit groups, grazing on the upper reaches of acacia trees. Giraffes usually avoid conflict. However, when its young are threatened or if the giraffe is cornered, it attacks ruthlessly, striking with its powerful hooves. Giraffes rarely use their necks to make slam attacks unless they are fighting among themselves as part of their mating displays.

A giraffe is between 16 and 20 feet tall and weighs 3,500 pounds.

True masters of the wild, deer gracefully glide through meadows and among the thickets of the deepest forests. Found in all climates and most terrains, deer form tightly knit herds for protection. These creatures fall victim to predators, and many humanoids hunt the animals for food and hides. They're not picky eaters, and consume all manner of plant material. In areas where humanoids live, deer can become pests as they graze in fields and destroy gardens in search of food.

The stat block shown above represents a male deer (a stag). Unlike caribou and other similar animals, female deer only rarely grow antlers, thus they lack gore attacks. Stags are approximately 6 feet long from nose to tail and weigh up to 350 pounds.
