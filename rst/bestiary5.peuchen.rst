Enormous winged snakes, peuchens range in color from violet to vibrant green to glossy black; the most commonly encountered peuchens are a dark, tawny brown. Those in jungles tend to match the patterns found on local pythons. Rarely, they sport a series of red, white, and black bands, with the thin white band sandwiched between the thicker red and black bands. When peuchens are not flying, their leathery, batlike wings lie folded along their bodies, matching the coloration of the hides below. Their eyes are a brilliant green, with snakelike pupils. Peuchens have a smooth, dry texture to their diamond-shaped scales and smell faintly of nutmeg. Their fangs fold up into their jaw, but snap into place to bite prey with lightning speed.

When they hunt, peuchens take on the form of livestock, such as sheep, goats, and cattle, and they prefer to stalk places suffering from drought or famine. These ambush predators often trick shepherds or lone farmers into bringing them back to farms, homesteads, and towns, where they can slip out each night to prey on any creatures they can find. They ambush their prey by coiling up and lunging with their strikes from a distance father than their prey usually expects. Peuchens prefer to drain the blood of humanoids, but they will eat sheep, goats, cats, dogs, or poultry if they fail to capture their favorite prey. They happily lair in haylofts or open attics, but also create nests in large trees or rock formations. Peuchens lay 6-inch eggs in scattered groups of eight to 12, and leave the young to fend for themselves.

A peuchen measures around 12 feet long and 1 foot in diameter at its thickest point, with a wingspan of 8 feet; it weighs nearly 250 pounds.
