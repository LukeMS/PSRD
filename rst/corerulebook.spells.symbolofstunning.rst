Symbol of Stunning
===================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates

This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that all creatures within 60 feet of a \ *symbol of stunning*\ instead become :ref:`stunned <corerulebook.glossary#stunned>`\  for 1d6 rounds.

\ *Note*\ : Magic traps such as \ *symbol of stunning*\ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for \ *symbol of stunning*\ .
