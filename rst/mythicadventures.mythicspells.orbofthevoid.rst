Orb of the Void
================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`orb of the void <ultimatemagic.spells.orbofthevoid#orb_of_the_void>`

A creature that fails its save against the orb gains 2 negative levels rather than 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level.

\ **Augmented (6th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the orb doesn't automatically stop when in enters a space with a living creature, but the saving throw DC decreases by 2 for each creature after the first it affects each round.

An individual creature can be affected by the \ *orb of the void*\  only once per round, even if the orb moves through its space more than once.
