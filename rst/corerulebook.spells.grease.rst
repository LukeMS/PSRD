Grease
=======

\ **School**\ conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\ bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 standard action

\ **Components**\ V, S, M (butter)

\ **Range**\ close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

A \ *grease*\ spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered :ref:`flat-footed <corerulebook.glossary#flat_footed>`\ .

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a :ref:`Reflex <corerulebook.combat#reflex>`\  saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the \ *greased*\ item. A creature wearing \ *greased*\ armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their :ref:`CMD <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_defense>`\  to avoid being :ref:`grappled <corerulebook.glossary#grappled>`\ .
