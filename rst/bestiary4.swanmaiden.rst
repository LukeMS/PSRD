Special Abilities
==================

\ **Feather Cloak (Su)**\  Without her feather cloak, a swan maiden can't use her change shape ability.

\ **Transformation Ritual (Su)**\  A swan maiden can transform a willing good female humanoid into a swan maiden via a ritual that takes 24 hours. The humanoid loses her class and racial abilities.

Swan maidens are fey shapechangers who vow to protect unspoiled wilds from the encroachment of civilization or evil. They live in small flocks along secluded lakeshores. Because stealing a swan maiden's cloak robs her of her shapechanging ability, most maidens avoid humanoids and take up armor and weapons to defend themselves.
