Special Abilities
==================

\ **Bound Spirits (Su)**\  A nemhain is surrounded by a whirling cloud of spirits that are bound to her—often the spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life. As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack (with an attack bonus of +21). These spirits may be used to cause damage as if the nemhain had touched the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used to deliver a \ *harm*\  or :ref:`slay living <corerulebook.spells.slayliving#slay_living>`\  effect. Using these spirits to deliver one of these spell-like abilities is a swift action; the nemhain does not need to take a standard action to cast the spell-like ability, but it still counts against the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability. The nemhain can also send these spirits as a group up to 1 mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as long as they don't share her space, she can't use them to deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: :ref:`dispel evil <corerulebook.spells.dispelevil#dispel_evil>`\ , :ref:`raise dead <corerulebook.spells.raisedead#raise_dead>`\ , or :ref:`resurrection <corerulebook.spells.resurrection#resurrection>`\ . Such spells cause the spirits to vanish and to be useless to the nemhain for 1 hour. :ref:`true resurrection <corerulebook.spells.trueresurrection#true_resurrection>`\  makes the spirits useless for 24 hours.

\ **Profane Regeneration (Su)**\  This ability functions like regeneration except the nemhain possesses it despite the fact that she lacks a Constitution score. A nemhain reduced to 0 hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while her profane regeneration is active. As long as her profane regeneration is active, a nemhain ignores all damage that would reduce her hit points below 0.

\ **Rejuvenation (Su)**\  All nemhains are tied to a ritual object used in their creation. This object is typically a large statue, pillar, or monolith. Until this object is destroyed, a destroyed nemhain automatically rejuvenates back to full hit points 1d4 days after she is destroyed, always appearing adjacent to her ritual object.

A nemhain is formed when a soul deliberately assumes undead status as a means of protecting a person, object, place, or ideal. Often, a devoted priest or ally volunteers herself and her (often unwitting) kin for transformation into a nemhain in order to continue protecting her home even beyond her death. The blasphemous rituals used to create nemhains are often believed to have been lost.

While most nemhain aspirants are evil to begin with—such individuals are often members of cults worshiping deities of lost or forbidden secrets—occasionally a goodly creature considers protecting a site worthy of a corrupted, tortured existence. Such an act, however well intentioned, is destined to damn her for all eternity.
