Special Abilities
==================

\ **Echo of Reason (Su)**\  A selkie can instinctively alter the intonation of its voice to make anything it says sound more pleasing to those who understand it. When using the :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\  skill, a selkie treats its lies as one step more believable for the purposes of bonuses or penalties on the check.

\ **Shake (Ex)**\  On a successful critical hit with its bite attack, a selkie automatically violently shakes a Large or smaller target. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or it is dazed for 1 round. Even on a successful save, the target still takes a â2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks for the next 2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Selkies are clever and brutal seal-like creatures. Although capable predators, selkies are best known for their shapechanging ability, which allows them to come ashore in the guise of land dwellers and even live among other races before luring their prey beneath the waves to drown. In its natural form, a selkie has webbed, clawed hands and a muscular trunk ending in broad flippers. A selkie's head is a blend of human and seal, with large eyes and a mouth full of curved teeth. Selkies grow to a length of 6-1/2 feet, but can weigh up to 300 pounds. Selkies typically live up to 75 years.

Most selkies use their shapechanging abilities for mischief. A favorite selkie tactic is to take the shape of a young woman or child and then pretend to be drowning, reverting to its natural form when a person approaches.

Selkies are solitary for most of their lives. Males and females come together briefly during their spring mating season, and thereafter each female finds a secluded cave or beach to birth a single pup, which is abandoned after 2 to 3 years. Younger selkies then form packs with others of their kind until they can strike out on their own. Some selkies live among humanoids to assuage their loneliness, and may marry land dwellers. Offspring from these marriages resemble their non-selkie parents but have a yearning for the sea.
