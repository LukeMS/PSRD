Withdraw Affliction
====================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  psychic 6, shaman 6, spiritualist 5, witch 7

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one afflicted creature

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You push your hand into the subject, then withdraw an affliction from the body of the sufferer as a tangible object. This extraction appears as a slimy mass of flesh. The target creature is cured as if affected by :ref:`remove disease <corerulebook.spells.removedisease#remove_disease>`\ , :ref:`remove curse <corerulebook.spells.removecurse>`\ , or :ref:`neutralize poison <corerulebook.spells.neutralizepoison#neutralize_poison>`\ .

In addition, this slimy mass allows you to deliver the affliction to another as a touch attack, as if holding the charge for a touch spell. It has the same effect as the original affliction, with the same saving throw and DC.
