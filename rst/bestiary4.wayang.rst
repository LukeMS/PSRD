Special Abilities
==================

\ **Light and Dark (Su)**\  Once per day as an immediate action, a wayang can choose to be affected by positive and negative energy effects as if it were an undead creature, taking damage from positive energy and healing damage from negative energy. This ability lasts for 1 minute.

Originating from the Shadow Plane, wayangs are pixie-like in stature with extremely gangly limbs and skin the color of deep shadow. They follow a philosophy known as "The Dissolution," which teaches that in passing they again merge into shadow.
