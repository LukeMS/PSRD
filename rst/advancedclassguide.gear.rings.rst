The effect must be one that allowed a saving throw, can be removed by either :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  or :ref:`heal <corerulebook.spells.heal#heal>`\ , and be an effect against which the wearer failed her initial saving throw. If the wearer succeeds at the new save, the effect is removed even if succeeding at the save would normally have other consequences, and even if the effect normally requires multiple saves to remove. If the effect allowed more than one type of saving throw, use the type and DC for the first saving throw the wearer failed for the effect. The wearer can use the ring only once for each ongoing condition. As the wearer must regain a panache or grit point to reroll a save, the ring provides no benefit if she hasn't used any grit or panache.

Ring of Vengeful Blood Magic

This claw ring is made of red metal tinged with orange, and a long nail made of obsidian extends from the tip. It allows its wearer to cast a spell as an attack of opportunity. Three time per day, if the wearer is bloodraging and a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from him, the wearer can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less as the attack of opportunity. The spell must target the creature that provoked the attack or include it in the spell's area, and must be no higher than 3rd level. This counts as one of the wearer's attacks of opportunity for the round; casting this spell does not itself provoke an attack of opportunity.
