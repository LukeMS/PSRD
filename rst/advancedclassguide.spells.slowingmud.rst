Slowing Mud
============

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  druid 4, shaman 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (earth and water)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (see text)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude negates; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow>`\  spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the :ref:`slow <corerulebook.spells.slow>`\  effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as :ref:`create water <corerulebook.spells.createwater#create_water>`\  or :ref:`hydraulic push <advancedplayersguide.spells.hydraulicpush>`\ ) removes all the mud in 1 round.

A :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste>`\  effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste>`\ . :ref:`Slow <corerulebook.spells.slow>`\  does not stack with the effects of :ref:`slowing mud <advancedclassguide.spells.slowingmud>`\ . This spell cannot counter or dispel :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste>`\ .
