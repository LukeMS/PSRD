Goblins
********

Goblin society is defined by anarchy, cowardice, and malice. Goblins are shortsighted, focused solely on the now; they're all but incapable of planning more than a few days in advance. Unless they can find more prosperous folk to steal from—including other goblin tribes—they live a hard life of scrounging bugs and hunting small game to fill their hungry bellies. Wherever goblins travel, they leave a path of destruction and mayhem in their wake. Adaptable to many environments, they can change and evolve within a human's life span—a few generations for goblins—to become better at surviving in a given environment, which makes fighting them even more difficult the next time around.

Comfortable with living in garbage and oblivious to the concepts of sanitation and hygiene, goblins are easy to track by scent. Unfortunately for loot-crazed adventurers, goblins rarely have anything worthwhile to claim; their "treasures" might be a polished tin cup, a handful of red rocks, or a stick that intoxicates you when you chew it. Even the chief's treasure, stolen away from other goblins and hidden about the tribe's lair, is rarely worth more than a few gold coins.

Though goblins are as agile as rats, they're strangely accident-prone. In battle, their attacks are often as dangerous to themselves and their allies as to their enemies. When properly motivated by a powerful chieftain, an iron-fisted bandit, or a hobgoblin warlord, a large gang of goblins can cross the line from dangerous nuisance to true threat, but this is more a factor of strength in numbers than skill or training. Smarter masters use goblins as distractions or to cause havoc, relying on their activities to cover up a more devastating attack from a different direction. Settlers and adventurers who are familiar with goblins recognize that when these pests act uncharacteristically brave, competent, and loyal, something unusual is going on.

Goblins grow quite rapidly, and are considered adults at 5 years of age. Abundant breeding, fast maturation, and adaptable physiology give goblins the ability to thrive in nearly any climate. In times of abundance, goblins multiply even faster than normal, resulting in overpopulation and the eventual escalation of raiding. Goblin parenting consists primarily of making sure young goblins get food and don't wander too far. Until they're old enough to walk freely among the rest of the tribe, goblin young are often restrained with chains, ropes, and crude cages. Violence among young goblins is quite common and even encouraged by their tribes. Entertainment in the form of toddler goblin fights is not unheard of, and they may be armed with small knives, scavenged armaments, or just their own juvenile teeth and claws.

Goblins who reach physical maturity are expected to be able to feed themselves; those who can't are left to starve. The abilities to hunt, to steal, and to bully weaker folk lead to positions of influence and power within the tribe. Their species-wide illiteracy (born of a superstition that writing steals the words out of your head) means even the few goblins with a talent for magic or alchemy have little opportunity to learn about these subjects. As a result, practitioners of these difficult arts are often both awed and feared. Some goblins have a special knack for crafting weapons and mechanical objects used in the act of murder or destruction, though not many have the patience or skill with machines that kobolds do.

From an early age, goblins develop an obsession with fire. Goblins need little excuse to start a bonfire in celebration of anything, and goblin practical jokes often involve setting fire to other goblins or their possessions. Religious rituals, celebrations, funerals, and feasts all involve huge bonfires— and when goblins go to war, they bring fire with them.

Goblins have a deeply entrenched hatred for both dogs and horses, going far beyond their normal hatred for all things that kill goblins. Horses and dogs for their part seem to understand this at some instinctive level, and bite or otherwise lash out at goblins at every opportunity. Humans learned early in their interactions with goblins how to take advantage of this mutual aversion; most small villages near goblin territory have dogs chained on their outskirts to bark warnings and attack any goblins trying to sneak past.

Though superstitious by nature, goblins have no unifying faith. Some tribal leaders might worship a given demon or devil, but said creature is likely to be a complete fabrication the goblin believes is real. Others might worship a stump that looks like a face, an animal skeleton found in a cave, or a spooky wind. A tribe may adopt new gods and discard the old ones when a new leader rises to power.

Goblins have few cultural traditions and no oral history beyond the reminiscences of the eldest members of the tribe, but they are enthusiastic singers, and a good goblin song can spread from tribe to tribe over thousands of miles and last for generations. Goblin music is primitive and crude by most standards, usually describing some real or imagined victory in the tribe's past in graphic detail.

Goblin lairs are usually simple caves with nesting areas made of skins and dead grass; the more advanced "villages" are a disaster of ramshackle homes often built in ruins or shipwrecks, or out of refuse. Goblins show no interest in farming, and their crafting extends primarily to crudely converting other communities' trash into weapons and armor, such as the crude swords called "dogslicers."

Like cockroaches, once goblins gain a foothold on the fringes of society, they're extremely difficult to wipe out completely. Some communities deliberately look the other way when goblins infiltrate their refuse heaps, but a community that grows too complacent soon finds pets and even children in goblin cook pots.

Full statistics for goblins can be found in their :ref:`Bestiary entry <bestiary.goblin>`\ .

New Rules
##########

Most goblin innovations and advancements stem from their adaptability to new environments, willingness to experiment on themselves by trying to consume anything that might possibly be edible, and tolerance for disgusting living conditions.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#goblin_variants`:

Goblin Variants
****************

Goblins evolve quickly—within a few generations—in response to environmental pressures such as complete darkness or an abundance of food, creating variant specimens of the race.

\ **Oversized Goblins**\ : A few goblins attain a much larger size than their kin. No one is exactly sure why they grow to be giants among their kind, but it's probably due to a combination of luck, diet, and constant access to food. These goblins are monsters among their own kind, not just in height, but also in girth and in strength. If not cast out for eating all of the tribe's food, oversized goblins often become the bosses of their tribes, and the most powerful of them become chiefs.

Oversized goblins are Medium size, and grow to 4 to 5 feet tall. They tend to be particularly obese, weighing between 225 and 275 pounds. Instead of the normal racial ability score modifiers for goblins, oversized goblins gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a –2 penalty to Charisma.

Goblin Archetype
#################

The following archetype is available to goblins.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#winged_marauder`: `monstercodex.goblins#winged_marauder_(alchemist)`_

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#winged_marauder_(alchemist)`:

Winged Marauder (Alchemist)
============================

Goblin alchemists have created a mixture of pheromones that they use to manipulate and entice giant vultures or dire bats to do their bidding. These goblins strap harnesses to the chests of these flying animals and hang beneath them, dropping flaming alchemical solutions on the helpless folks below.

\ **Class Skills**\ : A winged marauder gains :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\ , :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\ , and :ref:`Ride <corerulebook.skills.ride#ride>`\  as class skills. These replace :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\ , :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\ , and :ref:`Use Magic Device <corerulebook.skills.usemagicdevice#use_magic_device>`\  as class skills.

\ **Flying Beast Tamer (Ex)**\ : At 1st level, a winged marauder acquires a flying mount as an animal companion. This works as the druid animal companion class feature, except the marauder must select a dire bat or giant vulture. The marauder's effective druid level is equal to his alchemist level. A marauder and his companion don't gain the share spells ability. This ability replaces the mutagen and persistent mutagen class features.

\ **Discovery**\ : A winged marauder can select the following additional discovery.

\ *Sipping Pet (Ex)*\  : As a standard action, the marauder can administer a dose of a liquid (such as an extract, infusion, potion, or an alchemical liquid like antitoxin) to his animal companion, even if the companion is unconscious. The alchemist must be adjacent to or riding the companion to use this ability. An alchemist must have the infusion discovery to select this discovery.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#goblin_oracle_curse`:

Goblin Oracle Curse
********************

The following oracle curse is available to goblins.

\ **Infested**\ : Insects, spiders, grubs, and other vermin plague you constantly. They crawl in your hair, fill your clothes, and fly or crawl into your mouth, nose, and ears. You take a –4 penalty on :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  checks, and when you first meet someone, the person's initial attitude toward you starts one level lower than normal. Animals shy away from you—you take a –4 penalty on :ref:`Handle Animal <corerulebook.skills.handleanimal#handle_animal>`\  checks. You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves versus poisons from insects, scorpions, and spiders, as well as the distraction ability of swarms of such creatures. At 5th level, you add :ref:`vomit swarm <advancedplayersguide.spells.vomitswarm#vomit_swarm>`\  to your list of spells known. At 7th level, your bonus on poison and distraction saves increases to +4, and you gain DR 10/— against all swarm damage. At 13th level, you add :ref:`swarm skin <advancedplayersguide.spells.swarmskin#swarm_skin>`\  to your list of spells known. At 17th level, you become immune to the swarm damage and the distraction ability of insect, scorpion, and spider swarms.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#goblin_witch_hex`:

Goblin Witch Hex
*****************

The following witch hex is available to goblins. 

\ **Mud Witch (Su)**\ : A witch with this hex can assume the form of viscous brown mud. The witch's type changes to ooze and she is able to squeeze through even the smallest cracks, but she can't make attacks or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in this form, and she loses her supernatural abilities. If the witch has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when she uses this hex. While the witch is in mud form, her speed becomes 10 feet and she gains a swim speed of 20 feet. The witch gains DR 10/slashing and cold resistance 10. At 10th level, while the witch is in mud form, her speed increases to 20 feet and her swim speed increases to 40 feet. She can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. The duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. This hex affects only the witch. The witch must have the swamp hag hex to select this hex.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#goblin_equipment`:

Goblin Equipment
*****************

The following equipment is available in goblin tribes with flying mounts.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#flying_straps`:

Flying Straps
==============

\ **Price**\  varies; \ **Weight**\  10 lbs.

\ **Flying straps**\  10 gp

\ **Flying straps, masterwork**\  80 gp

These crude straps are used to secure a goblin or other small creature to the underside of a dire bat or giant vulture . These straps count as an exotic riding saddle. If the mount fails a :ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly#fly>`\  check, there's a 50% chance the straps break and the rider falls. Masterwork flying straps count as an exotic military saddle, and don't have a chance to break if the mount fails a :ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly#fly>`\  check.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#goblin_spells`:

Goblin Spells
**************

The following spells are more common among goblin spellcasters than among other races.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#bouncy_body`:

Bouncy Body
============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  alchemist 1, bloodrager 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  10 minutes/level

The target's flesh becomes flexible and rubbery. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks and :ref:`Escape Artist <corerulebook.skills.escapeartist#escape_artist>`\  checks, as well as to its CMD against combat maneuver checks to grapple. Anytime the target would take falling damage, it treats falls as 20 feet shorter (minimum 0) for the purpose of determining damage. In addition, if the target falls against a hard surface, it can attempt an :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  check (DC = the distance fallen) to attempt to bounce upward; success means the creature bounces upward half the distance fallen.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#mud_buddy`:

Mud Buddy
==========

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation); \ **Level**\  druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (1 pint of water)

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  5 cubic feet of earth or mud

\ **Duration**\  1 hour/level (D) (see text)

You create a Small minion out of mud, and it obeys your commands. The mud buddy has AC 12, 10 hit points, Strength 5, and a speed of 30 feet. It can perform any tasks an :ref:`unseen servant <corerulebook.spells.unseenservant#unseen_servant>`\  can, plus any similar tasks its Strength allows (it's able to lift up to 50 pounds), but instead of walking on water, it gains a swim speed of 30 feet.

You can command a \ *mud buddy*\  to move up to 5 feet and trip an opponent (CMB = your caster level + your spellcasting ability score modifier). After the trip attempt is resolved, the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the \ *mud buddy*\  reverts to a patch of wet earth.

.. _`monstercodex.goblins#goblin_formula_books`:

Goblin Formula Books
=====================

Goblins are illiterate, so goblin alchemists are unable to use conventional formula books. Instead, a goblin alchemist's formula book is filled with smears of various fluids, pictures representing materials needed, and other scent-, taste-, or pictograph-based representations of his formulae. Goblin alchemists can learn each other's formulae as easily as other alchemists learn language-based formulae.

A literate alchemist can learn formulae from a goblin alchemist's book, but he must spend 1 day studying a formula (instead of 1 hour), and the :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  DC to successfully learn it is equal to 20 + the formula's level (instead of 15 + the formula's level). This otherwise works like copying a formula from another alchemist's formula book.

Goblins cannot learn formulae from scrolls or language-based books, but can be taught a new formula by an alchemist or wizard who spends 1 day verbally explaining it.

Strapped to her giant vulture companion, the goblin vulture pilot is a peerless scout and saboteur. Enemies find goblin vulture pilots tough to pin down as they lob explosive bombs from the air. Vulture pilots are braver, more disciplined, and more patient than most goblins, as they have to sneak into giant vulture nests to steal eggs, resist the temptation to eat those eggs, and raise the hatchlings to be loyal mounts. Many pilots die in flying accidents; the lucky ones often discover how to craft extracts of \ *bouncy body*\ , :ref:`levitate <corerulebook.spells.levitate#levitate>`\ , or similar effects to help them survive the inevitable crashes.

Goblin vulture pilots take great pride in their abilities, and often wear their mounts' feathers as headdresses or paint themselves with guano as marks of status.

Frog-talkers are among the most feared of all goblins; most don't even want to be on the good sides of these witches. Frog-talkers are cruel and fearless masters. It's said the frog-talkers bathe in mud and leeches every fortnight to renew their dedication to their patron, the god of filth and blood—and based on their pale complexions and emaciated frames, few doubt it. These mysterious witches often live alone, or surround themselves with acolytes and terrified goblin minions given to them by superstitious chieftains.

No two goblins will give you the same answer about why they fear frog-talkers. Some legends claim that the frog-talkers aren't real goblins, but swamp ghosts in disguise. Others claim that they're indeed goblins, but controlled by hideous brain-leeches that have wriggled into their ears. And still others say that worshiping the filth god is scary enough on its own.

Regardless of what their origins may be, frog-talkers are powerful spellcasters who vomit up swarms of swamp creatures to do their bidding and fry disobedient minions with sizzling lightning. The only mortal creatures a frog-talker seems to truly respect are (naturally) frogs, and most keep a frog or toad on their person at all times. But the most worrying aspect of frog-talkers is that they don't appear to feel fear—an otherwise omnipresent aspect of goblin life.

Goblin stickylords are a decidedly bizarre breed of goblin alchemists. Unlike normal goblin alchemists, who focus on spreading around as much fire and flame as possible, stickylords have learned the value of locking enemies in place and \ *then*\  burning them.

In order to make their gluey concoctions, goblin stickylords explore every aspect of adhesion, combining mundane materials like glue, pitch, and less pleasant substances with magic. These unique reagents are often harvested by lesser goblin minions—the better to keep the powerful stickylord from getting covered in bee stings or drowning in mud. (Sadly for these minions, stickylords need test subjects, so even faithful service is no guarantee that they won't be stuck to a stump in order for a stickylord to try out a new formula—or practice aiming.)

On the battlefield, stickylords use their tanglefoot bomb discovery to stick enemies to the ground while the bomb's clinging fire does its job. Many command lesser alchemists or teams of pyromaniacs armed with fire arrows and alchemist's fire, who are ready to lob their projectiles once the stickylord can get the enemy to stop moving around.

Despite their obsession, goblin stickylords are careful to always carry powerful solvents, as even the best of them wind up glued in place on occasion.

\ **CR**\ : Same as the base creature + 1.

\ **Armor Class**\ : Natural armor bonus increases by 4.

\ **Mutations**\ : A mutant goblin gains four of the following mutations, determined randomly when it gains the template. For every 5 Hit Dice it has (5, 10, and so on), it gains another random mutation. (Other possible mutations include tusks, a spiked tail, and gills.)

\ *Breath Weapon (Su)*\  : The goblin can spew a line of foul acidic blood from its mouth (20-foot line, Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 Hit Die + its Constitution modifier for half damage, 1d4 points of acid damage per HD, usable every 1d4 rounds). If it has 5 or more HD, the range increases to 30 feet and the damage increases to 1d6 points of acid damage per HD.

\ *Claws (Ex)*\  : The goblin's hands become claws. It gains a natural claw attack for each hand that deals damage appropriate to its size, and gains the grab ability with its claws.

\ *Extra Arm (Ex)*\  : The goblin gains an extra arm with a functional hand, as the vestigial arm discovery. If it gains this mutation again, it gains another arm.

\ *Fast Healing (Ex)*\  : The goblin gains fast healing 1. If it has 5 Hit Dice or more, this increases to fast healing 2. If the creature has 10 HD or more, this increases to fast healing 5.

\ *Venomous Bite (Ex)*\  : The mutant goblin grows large fangs, gaining a poisonous bite as a natural attack that deals damage appropriate to its size. The poison functions like wyvern poison, except its DC is 10 + 1/2 HD + its Constitution modifier.

\ *Wings (Ex)*\  : The goblin gains dragonfly wings, granting it a fly speed of 30 feet with clumsy maneuverability.

\ **Abilities**\ : Str +4, Int –2.
