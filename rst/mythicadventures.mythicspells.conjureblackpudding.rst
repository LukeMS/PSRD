Conjure Black Pudding
======================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`conjure black pudding <ultimatemagic.spells.conjureblackpudding#conjure_black_pudding>`

The black pudding has fast healing equal to your tier, as do any puddings that :ref:`split <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#split>`\  off from it. The black puddings from this spell never attack you, though they're otherwise uncontrolled and might attack your allies if there are no other obvious opponents.

\ **Augmented (6th)**\ : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the pudding gains the savage mythic template (see page 224). Puddings that split off from the giant pudding don't gain the template.
