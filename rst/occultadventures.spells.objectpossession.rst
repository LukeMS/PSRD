Object Possession, Lesser
==========================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  medium 2, mesmerist 3, occultist 2, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 3, witch 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  unattended Tiny or Small object

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  None; \ **Spell Resistance**\  No

This spell functions as :ref:`possession <occultadventures.spells.possession#possession>`\ , except you possess an object instead of a creature.

A possessed object becomes capable of animation, gaining the statistics of an animated object of its size (including 1 CP worth of abilities; \ *PRD Bestiary*\  14). You can't use any spells or other abilities while possessing an object.

A spiritual tether connects your body to the possessed object, in a manner similar to a silver cord. If the possessed object and your body are ever farther than close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) from one another, this tether breaks, returning your consciousness to your body.
