An apprentice delivers orders when not practicing her craft. She usually begins her apprenticeship as a young adult, serves for 7 years, and is paid mostly in room and board at the master's home or shop. After this duration, the apprentice becomes a journeyman in the craft and is paid a daily wage by the master. Some, however may instead leave to start their own businesses with employees once they reach the journeyman stage. A typical artisan has only one apprentice at a time, but a famous or wealthy one may have multiple apprentices at once.

The above stat block can be used for any sort of trade that requires fine skill but not great strength, such as cobbling, dyeing, weaving, glass-blowing, locksmithing, or pottery-making. It can also be used to represent skilled professionals such as carriage drivers and house servants.

Quite weathered for an elf, a sailor spends most of his free time playing cards, making music, or whittling away at wood or ivory. Old sailors are superstitious and wary of bad omens before or during a voyage.

Though an old sailor is able to defend himself if attacked, his work relates to ship maintenance and transporting cargo rather than repelling boarders. For an experienced military sailor, use the veteran buccaneer stat block (page 267) or apply the advanced creature simple template to the old sailor stat block. You can also use this stat block for laborers whose work requires strength and maneuverability, such as lumberjacks.

A trapper catches animals with snares, then turns their hides into leather and fur goods. Most are independent folk, content to live on the edge of civilization so they don't have to deal with the niceties of polite society. A few find themselves trying to escape a past crime or tragedy, using the wilderness to hide and eking out a livelihood from the natural world. Most know the best places to hunt and trap, hidden paths that lead to observation points, and the locations of caves and dangerous natural hazards.

In frontier areas, a seasoned trapper is the next best thing to a guide, scout, tracker, or sniper, and in wartime many serve in the local militia, using their keen eyes and deadly skills to keep villagers safe and provide food. In exchange for a few coins, they may lead adventurers to the edge of monster territory or provide food or shelter in a storm.

A journeyman carpenter is skilled with a hammer, but tries to avoid violence except to defend himself and his family. Tools can be rebuilt or replaced, and he will not waste his life protecting mere objects.

The above stat block can be used for any journeyman whose trade requires skill and strength, such as a blacksmith, stonemason, or teamster. The stat block can also be used for older warriors in orc or hobgoblin tribes who are not as vigorous but are still able to fight.

Sappers specialize in undermining fortifications and tunneling under walls. Using a combination of time, engineering, and explosives, sappers can rig a tunnel to collapse to protect a retreat or create a path over a mountainside. Their enthusiasm for blowing things up means they take unnecessary risks, and the lifespan of a professional sapper is often cut short in a dramatic blast.

A wise sage's cantankerous manner evaporates when she's expounding on matters of scholarly minutia. The sage's breadth of general knowledge allows her to speak on most topics, and her precious magic items let her gain enough clues to direct her further research. If she reaches her limit on a topic, she may refer the questioner to a specialist in that field—or she may not, in order to preserve her pride.

A cutthroat lawyer is a master of loopholes, doublespeak, intimidation, and litigation. She prides herself on doing whatever it takes—within the law—to win her case. Though this means she won't use illusions to falsify evidence or enchantments to alter a witness's memories or coerce a judge or juror to change a vote, it leaves her many opportunities to enhance her own ability to persuade and investigate. Given enough gold and access to the right potions, she destroys the opposition's arguments, eradicates the witnesses' credibility, discovers conflicts of interest in judges and jurors, digs up obscure laws that invalidate the charges of which her client is accused, suggests plausible conspiracies or mistaken identities, points fingers at other possible suspects, bogs down trial proceedings, and offers plea bargains to a trivially smaller sentence in order to get trials over with.

She loves the intellectual and magical challenge of defeating her opponent within the bounds of the law, much as a paladin enjoys a victory without resorting to dishonorable tactics. She thrives on the attention and her ability to manipulate others to see things as she wants them to. If she worked as a prosecutor, her conviction record would be nearly perfect, but because she loves a good profit, she prefers aggressive litigation and defending the accused. Any magic she uses to achieve a win is added to her bill, and her favorite clients are rich adventurers because they have the deepest pockets.

The lawyer does have standards, and will not defend those accused of crimes against children. Likewise, she prefers clients who are not actually guilty, or are guilty of crimes against property rather than against people.

The lawyer has a network of contacts, observers, and expert witnesses ready to follow people, investigate crime scenes, badger city guards for information, testify in trials, and otherwise make themselves useful for her profession. She usually has the assistance of one or more less skilled lawyers (use the successful merchant stat block, expert 7) hoping to gain some prestige by association, and payrolls two or three investigator wizards (human diviner 4) at any one time. All of these agents are people she believes she can trust not to violate any laws in the pursuit of information, for one slip-up can invalidate her entire case and—worst of all—embarrass her professionally. An agent who shows a lack of discretion or discipline in this matter is cut off and disavowed; depending on the infraction, she might bring her litigious powers to bear against that person, in which case it is usually best for the target to flee the city, change his or her name, and attempt a new life somewhere else.

Accomplished as an acrobat, clown, dancer, juggler, and piper, a master entertainer augments her performance with magical effects for audiences that pay high enough ticket prices. Odd-looking even by gnome standards, she is adept at making herself appear male or female, a human or elf child, or even something monstrous like a goblin or tiefling. When augmented by her magic cap, the disguise is instantaneous and flawless. It is often her practice to create a mundane disguise, then use the cap to create an identical disguise over it, so that any who magically detect or penetrate the disguise see the same thing underneath, leading them to believe their magic is erratic.

If working for a wealthy patron, she uses her funding to create surreal and amusing backdrops, stages, and costumes, sometimes with colors only visible to certain races, or concealing words and images that appear only when viewed with darkvision. She uses these props to perform whimsical narratives that are suitable for children, but that can easily be altered into something haunting, disturbing, or even erotic or blasphemous with a word from her employer. She has been known to employ illusionists to add or subtract elements from a performance, or (like her habit with disguises) create identical illusions on top of actual scenery, perhaps altering it slightly to give the performance a sense of heightened unreality.

Because of her experience traveling with unsavory characters, she has no qualms about being bribed to help with many crimes, such as smuggling goods into or out of a city, faking a person's death as an on-stage "accident," or mocking an effigy or caricature of a public official in a performance in front of hundreds of witnesses.

She may travel alone or as part of a troupe of actors or musicians (use the journeyman carpenter stat block, expert 4), tavern singers (bards 1), street performers (bards 2), or laborers (use the ruffian stat block, commoner 7). During most of her travels she is content to cavort and entertain, but from time to time she sneaks out to burgle or rob the rich and split the money with her companions.

The above stat block can be used for any kind of skilled nonmagical performer or artisan, such as an actor, musician, painter, or singer. Alter the NPC's magic items to suit the particular role; for example, scrolls of :ref:`eagle's splendor <corerulebook.spells.eaglessplendor#eagle_s_splendor>`\  instead of scrolls of :ref:`cat's grace <corerulebook.spells.catsgrace#cat_s_grace>`\ .
