Knock
======

\ **Source**\  :ref:`knock <corerulebook.spells.knock#knock>`

The spell unlocks up to three means of closure instead of two. The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so). If used on a door locked with :ref:`arcane lock <corerulebook.spells.arcanelock#arcane_lock>`\ , you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ , adding your tier to the check.

\ **Augmented (3rd)**\ : You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an :ref:`arcane lock <corerulebook.spells.arcanelock#arcane_lock>`\  on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed).

If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesn't automatically open.

The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.
