This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a –4 penalty on :ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly>`\  skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 :ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly>`\  skill check or be blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 :ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly>`\  skill check to move against the force of the wind.

A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

Small creatures are knocked :ref:`prone <corerulebook.glossary#prone>`\  by the force of the wind.

Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  check.

Large or larger creatures may move normally within a \ *gust of wind*\ effect.

This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception>`\  checks in the area of a \ *gust of wind*\ .

The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.

In addition to the effects noted, a \ *gust of wind*\ can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

\ *Gust of wind*\ can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell.
