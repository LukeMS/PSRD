Druid
******

Druids are the keepers of the wildlands, the guardians watching at nature's border to ensure that hubristic civilization does not overreach its bounds. From the highest mountain peaks to the steaming jungles and seas, druids learn and draw their power from their surrounding environment and the creatures that live there. Like nature itself, druids can be gentle and succoring or red in tooth and claw, and need answer only to the wind and the rain.

Presented below are new variant class rules to help you customize your druid for specific terrain types, as well as rules for druidic shamans who worship specific totem animals.

The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster.
