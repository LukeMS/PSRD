Inflict Light Wounds
=====================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  cleric 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  half; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.

Inflict Light Wounds, Mass
===========================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  cleric 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  half; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) to nearby living enemies.

Like other \ *inflict*\ spells, mass :ref:`inflict light wounds <corerulebook.spells.inflictlightwounds#inflict_light_wounds>`\  cures undead in its area rather than damaging them. A cleric capable of spontaneously casting \ *inflict*\ spells can also spontaneously cast \ *mass inflict*\ spells.
