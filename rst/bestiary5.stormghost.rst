Special Abilities
==================

\ **Adaptive Camouflage (Ex)**\  A stormghost's hide shifts coloration over time to match its environment, granting it +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks within the ranger favored terrain type matching its current terrain. A stormghost moving to a different terrain must stay 1d4 weeks to gain the bonus.

\ **Impaling Leap (Ex)**\  As a standard action, a stormghost can leap onto a target at least one size category smaller than itself and impale the victim. The target suffers 6d8+16 points of piercing damage and is pinned (DC 26 Reflex negates). The stormghost must maintain the pin as normal. Pinned foes take impaling leap damage each round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

\ **Static Aura (Su)**\  A stormghost can surround itself with crackling electricity that leaps from its body. All creatures within 5 feet of the stormghost take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the stormghost's turn. A stormghost can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

\ **Static Blast (Su)**\  As a standard action, a stormghost can focus its static charge into a bolt, releasing it in a 40-foot line that deals 15d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 25 Reflex save halves this damage. A stormghost can use its static blast once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Cunning hunters, stormghosts prowl lonely arctic tors, so named by their victims for their ability to conjure malignant weather and attack unseen. Stormghosts search constantly for food, tracking animals and intelligent creatures alike, and their appearances vary depending on the season, allowing them to blend into any environment. While stormghosts are thankfully rare, their regeneration mitigates the effects of aging, allowing them to live for more than 2,000 years. A typical stormghost stands 8 feet tall in its regular posture, but can extend its legs to reach up to 14 feet, with its muscled flesh and hardened chitin armor making it weigh roughly 1,500 pounds.
