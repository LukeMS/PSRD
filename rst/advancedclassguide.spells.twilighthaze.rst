Twilight Haze
==============

\ **School**\  illusion (shadow) [darkness, shadow]; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Effect**\  fog spreads in 20-ft. radius

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You create a gray haze that obscures sight (as :ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\ ) and causes the illumination level within it to dim by one step (as per :ref:`darkness <corerulebook.spells.darkness>`\ ). Since this spell produces an illusion rather than a true physical fog, it is unaffected by wind and can be cast underwater.
