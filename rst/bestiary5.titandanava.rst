Special Abilities
==================

\ **Danava Mantle (Su)**\  The ornate mantle a danava wears grants it a +9 deflection bonus to its AC. It functions for other Colossal mythic creatures in the same way, but not for non-mythic creatures or those of other sizes.

\ **Devastator (Su)**\  As a full-round action, a danava can make a single attack at its highest base attack bonus with its tetsubo or slam attack. This attack counts as a :ref:`Vital Strike <corerulebook.feats#vital_strike>`\  despite not using an attack action. On a successful hit, this attack bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If used to perform a sunder combat maneuver or to damage an object, the attack is capable of critical hits (despite objects' usual immunity to critical hits) and is automatically treated as a critical threat.

\ **Iron Resilience (Ex)**\  Once per round, a danava can completely ignore an attack (whether it required an attack roll, was a targeted spell, or was an area attack, and regardless of whether it would cause damage or not). A danava can expend one use of mythic power to ignore an additional attack beyond the first in the same round; this ability uses no action and can be activated so long as the danava has mythic power remaining. The danava can choose to use this ability after the result of any attack roll, caster level check to overcome spell resistance, saving throw, or other pertinent check is revealed.

Chained for eons beneath the deepest waves of the endless seas, danavas are the eldest and first of the great outsiders collectively known as titans. Conceived originally at the foundation of reality to govern and regulate the mercurial forces that shaped the cosmos, danavas ultimately proved too harsh, too rigid, and too unflinching for their mission. Finally, when the danavas went to war with their chaotic and less powerful brethren, the gods interceded before creation was rent asunder, placing their elder children in stasis beneath the waves, buried at the cruxes of many worlds.

Danavas resemble thick—even rotund—but extremely muscular humans of incredible size. Reaching heights of 75 to 100 feet, danavas can weigh up to 200 tons. Their ancient ornamentations cover most of their red-brown skin, and their helmets always reveal their wagon-wheel-sized, pupilless eyes.

Since the time of their imprisonment, the danavas have seldom emerged from beneath the waves. When freed from its sequestration, a danava surfaces in an attempt to restore balance to the world, whether through the raising of an elder god, perhaps devastating a race of humanoids on the brink of a destructive discovery or crushing the unchecked hubris of their own lesser kin. And although danavas focus singularly on their targets, they coldly and ruthlessly dispatch enemies attempting to thwart that goal, raining down lightning and laying waste to entire cities, wreaking fearsome havoc that becomes the stuff of legends. In combat, the titans typically use their massive brawn in conjunction with its mythic resilience to outlast enemies, saving their spell-like abilities for specific targets that pose a greater danger.

While the forces that release danavas into the world are mysterious, the great outsiders function with autonomy. If a danava's fury is successfully checked or resisted, the creature can be reasoned with. Typically, the titan divulges its charge and purpose, and explains the need for its actions, but without looking for pardon or expressing remorse. Danavas see the absolutes of the universe and rarely appreciate complexity or nuance. While danavas are usually lawful neutral, some lawful good and lawful evil danavas do exist. Lawful good danavas endeavor to cause the minimum necessary destruction to achieve their goals. Once they have righted whatever imbalance they were released to fix, danavas return to the fathomless depths until again no living memory of them remains.

.. _`bestiary5.titandanava#danava_pillar`:

Danava Pillar
**************

Certain danavas have, over the eons, merged with the cruxes of the universe they oversee. These danava pillars are more powerful than normal, and destroying one would be a step toward unraveling reality itself, so they are targets for creatures like the :ref:`hundun <bestiary5.hundun>`\ , who wish to destroy entire dimensions. Danava pillars are always 10th mythic rank, and they vary from CR 25 to 30. This increase comes from templates like the advanced simple template, class levels, or both. Each danava pillar gains a unique ability from its connection to the fundamental linchpins of the universe, including (but not limited to) the following.

\ **Akashic Guru (Ex)**\ : The danava pillar is connected to the Akashic Record. It gains a +20 racial bonus on all Knowledge checks, and it can expend 1 point of mythic power to recall its previous self from the Akashic Record without spending an action. If it does so, it is restored to full hit points, regains all uses of its spell-like abilities, and loses all conditions and spells currently affecting it (beneficial or detrimental); it does not regain any uses of mythic power. Since the ability does not require an action, the danava pillar can use this ability even when it can't take actions, as the universe itself attempts to prevent the threatened destruction of the pillar.

\ **Temporal Lord (Ex)**\ : The danava pillar is connected to the Dimension of Time, and its multidimensional existence doesn't connect or relate to time in the same way as a typical creature's. Each round, just before its normal actions, the danava pillar benefits from effects identical to those of the spell :ref:`time stop <corerulebook.spells.timestop#time_stop>`\ (though this isn't a spell effect). It doesn't spend an action to do so—this is simply a natural consequence of its nonlinear experience of time.

\ **Yin and Yang (Ex)**\ : The danava pillar is connected to the Positive and Negative Energy Planes and the transmigration of souls. Both positive and negative energy heal the pillar (whether channeled to heal or to harm), and it can channel positive and negative energy at will once per round each as a free action. The channeled energy's effect is as a 20th-level cleric's. The danava pillar gains :ref:`Selective Channeling <corerulebook.feats#selective_channeling>`\  as a bonus feat. Finally, a creature reduced to 0 hit points or below by any of the danava pillar's attacks is instantly reincarnated into its next life. Unlike the spell :ref:`reincarnate <corerulebook.spells.reincarnate#reincarnate>`\ , this transforms the creature into an infant with no class levels and little or no memory of its former life. Restoring the original creature from its new incarnation requires a \ *miracle*\ , a \ *wish*\ , or similar magic, and as doing so simultaneously eliminates the new incarnation, it could have profound moral or ethical implications for the restorer.
