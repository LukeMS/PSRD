Shrink Item
============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one touched object of up to 2 cu. ft./level

\ **Duration**\  1 day/level; see text

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (object); :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (object)

You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a \ *shrink item*\ spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.

\ *Shrink item*\ can be made permanent with a :ref:`permanency <corerulebook.spells.permanency#permanency>`\  spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.
