River Whip
===========

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation) [water]; \ **Level**\  magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S

\ **Range**\  0 ft.

\ **Effect**\  whip of water

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D) or until discharged (see text)

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You create a coil of flowing fresh water, functioning as a whip appropriate for your size, except you make a melee touch attack instead of a regular attack. Anything you strike with the whip takes damage and is doused with 1 pint of water. A creature with the fire subtype takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If the target is on fire, it gains a +2 bonus on its next saving throw to extinguish the flames.

After you have successfully used the whip to hit a creature a number of times equal to your caster level, the water is expended and the spell is discharged. The water created by this spell is otherwise identical to that produced by :ref:`create water <corerulebook.spells.createwater>`\ .
