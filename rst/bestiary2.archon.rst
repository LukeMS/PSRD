Special Abilities
==================

\ **Spear and Shield (Su)**\  At will as a free action, a shield :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\  can transform his hands into a +1 tower :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\  and a \ *+3 shortspear*\ , or either individually, or back to hands again. He cannot transform both hands into shields or both into shortspears. A shield :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\  never takes the typical –2 penalty on attack rolls while wielding a tower shield. A shield :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\ 's weapons cannot be disarmed, but they can be sundered. If a shield :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\  loses his spear or shield, he can manifest a new one as a full-round action. When a shield :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\  is slain, these two items fade away—they cannot be looted or wielded by any other creature.

\ **Stability (Ex)**\  Shield archons receive a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.

\ **Transpose Ally (Su)**\  Once per day as a standard action, a shield :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\  can teleport to the location of a willing (or unconscious) ally and immediately teleport that ally to the :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\ 's previous position, in effect switching places with the ally. The :ref:`archon <bestiary.creaturetypes#archon_subtype>`\  must have line of effect to the target. 

Shield archons are the mighty rocks of celestial armies, withstanding waves of demons and devils without complaint. Though more than capable of tearing apart lesser demons and devils, their true strength lies in their ability to shrug off deadly attacks from superior opponents, giving their offense-oriented allies time to flank and overwhelm their mutual foes. Shield archons are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.
