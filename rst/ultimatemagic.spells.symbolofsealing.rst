Symbol of Sealing
==================

\ **School**\  abjuration [force]; \ **Level**\  cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6

\ **Casting Time**\ s 10 minutes

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorous, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

\ **Range**\  0 ft.; see text

\ **Effect**\  one symbol

\ **Duration**\  permanent

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`\ . Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`\  first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.

When scribing a \ *symbol of sealing*\ , you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the \ *symbol of sealing*\ , but doing this extends the casting time as described under :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ . However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attunedâ€”the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.

A :ref:`disintegrate <corerulebook.spells.disintegrate#disintegrate>`\  spell or similar effect can destroy the wall of force created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A :ref:`knock <corerulebook.spells.knock#knock>`\  spell has no effect on a \ *symbol of sealing*\  or its force wall. A \ *symbol of sealing*\  cannot be dispelled, but :ref:`mage's disjunction <corerulebook.spells.magesdisjunction#mage_s_disjunction>`\  automatically destroys it.
