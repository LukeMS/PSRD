A magic weapon is enhanced to strike more truly and deliver more damage. Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonuses on attack rolls do not stack with their enhancement bonuses on attack rolls.

Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonuses apply to both melee and ranged attacks.

Some magic weapons have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. Weapons cannot possess the same special ability more than once.

Weapons or ammunition can be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material (see :ref:`Equipment <corerulebook.equipment>`\ ).

\ **Caster Level for Weapons**\ : The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

\ **Additional Damage Dice**\ : Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.

\ **Ranged Weapons and Ammunition**\ : The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming :ref:`damage reduction <corerulebook.glossary#damage_reduction>`\ . Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon.

\ **Magic Ammunition and Breakage**\ : When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or is otherwise rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that successfully hits a target is automatically destroyed after it delivers its damage.

\ **Light Generation**\ : Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a \ *light*\ spell. These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can't be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

\ **Hardness and Hit Points**\ : Each +1 of a magic weapon's enhancement bonus adds +2 to its hardness and +10 to its hit points.

\ **Activation**\ : Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by wielding (attacking with) it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action). A character can activate the special abilities of 50 pieces of ammunition at the same time, assuming each piece has identical abilities.

\ **Magic Weapons and Critical Hits**\ : Some weapon special abilities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect also functions against creatures not normally subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage. 

\ **Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures**\ : The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies (see :ref:`Equipment <corerulebook.equipment>`\ ). The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

\ **Special Qualities**\ : Roll d%. A 01–30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31–45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 46–100 indicates no special qualities.

A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_anarchic`:

\ **Anarchic**\ : An \ *anarchic weapon*\  is infused with the power of chaos.

It bestows one permanent :ref:`negative level <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ cannot be overcome in any way (including \ *restoration*\ spells) while the weapon is wielded.

\ **Bane**\ : A \ *bane weapon*\  excels against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than its actual bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against the foe. To randomly determine a weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_brilliant_energy`:

\ **Brilliant Energy**\ : A \ *brilliant energy weapon*\  has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A \ *brilliant energy weapon*\  ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (:ref:`Dexterity <corerulebook.gettingstarted#dexterity>`\ , deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A \ *brilliant energy weapon*\  cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_dancing`:

\ **Dancing**\ : As a standard action, a \ *dancing weapon*\ can be loosed to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. The weapon is considered wielded or attended by the creature for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, the weapon shares the same space as the activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved, the weapon can't dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_defending`:

\ **Defending**\ : A \ *defending weapon*\  allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to his :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  lasts until his next turn.

\ **Flaming Burst**\ : A \ *flaming burst weapon*\  functions as a :ref:`flaming weapon <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_flaming>`\  that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the \ *flaming*\  ability (see above), a \ *flaming burst weapon*\  deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage. 

Even if the \ *flaming*\  ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_ghost_touch`:

\ **Ghost Touch**\ : A \ *ghost touch weapon*\  deals damage normally against :ref:`incorporeal <corerulebook.glossary#incorporeal>`\  creatures, regardless of its bonus. An :ref:`incorporeal <corerulebook.glossary#incorporeal>`\  creature's 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with \ *ghost touch weapons*\ . The weapon can be picked up and moved by an :ref:`incorporeal <corerulebook.glossary#incorporeal>`\  creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a \ *ghost touch weapon*\  counts as both corporeal or :ref:`incorporeal <corerulebook.glossary#incorporeal>`\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_holy`:

\ **Holy**\ : A \ *holy weapon*\  is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding :ref:`damage reduction <corerulebook.glossary#damage_reduction>`\ . It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. It bestows one permanent :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ cannot be overcome in any way (including by \ *restoration*\ spells) while the weapon is wielded.

The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the \ *frost*\  ability, an \ *icy burst weapon*\  deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points. 

Even if the \ *frost*\  ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_keen`:

\ **Keen**\ : This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing melee weapons can be \ *keen*\ . If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll. This benefit doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the :ref:`keen edge <corerulebook.spells.keenedge#keen_edge>`\  spell or the :ref:`Improved Critical <corerulebook.feats#improved_critical>`\  feat).

Moderate transmutation\ *;*\ CL 10th; :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , :ref:`keen edge <corerulebook.spells.keenedge#keen_edge>`\ ; Price +1 bonus.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_ki_focus`:

\ **Ki Focus**\ : The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder's ki, allowing her to use her special \ *ki*\ attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk's :ref:`ki  <corerulebook.classes.monk#ki_pool>`\ :ref:`strike <corerulebook.classes.monk#ki_pool>`\ , :ref:`quivering palm <corerulebook.classes.monk#quivering_palm>`\ , and the :ref:`Stunning Fist <corerulebook.feats#stunning_fist>`\  feat (including any condition that the monk can apply using this feat). Only melee weapons can have the \ *ki focus*\  ability.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , creator must be a monk; Price +1 bonus.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_merciful`:

\ **Merciful**\ : The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage it deals is nonlethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until told to resume it (allowing it to deal lethal damage, but without any bonus damage from this ability).

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , :ref:`cure light wounds <corerulebook.spells.curelightwounds#cure_light_wounds>`\ ; Price +1 bonus.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_mighty_cleaving`:

\ **Mighty Cleaving**\ : A \ *mighty cleaving weapon*\  allows a wielder using the :ref:`Cleave <corerulebook.feats#cleave>`\  feat to make one additional attack if the first attack hits, as long as the next foe is adjacent to the first and also within reach. This additional attack cannot be against the first foe. Only melee weapons can be \ *mighty cleaving weapons*\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_returning`:

\ **Returning**\ : This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. A \ *returning weapon*\  flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the thrower just before the creature's next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching a \ *returning weapon*\  when it comes back is a free action. If the character can't catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.

Moderate transmutation\ *;*\ CL 7th; :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , :ref:`telekinesis <corerulebook.spells.telekinesis#telekinesis>`\ ; Price +1 bonus.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_seeking`:

\ **Seeking**\ : Only ranged weapons can have the \ *seeking*\ ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_shocking_burst`:

\ **Shocking Burst**\ : A \ *shocking burst weapon*\  functions as a :ref:`shock weapon <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_shock>`\  that explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the \ *shock*\  ability, a \ *shocking burst weapon*\  deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.

Even if the \ *shock*\  ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_speed`:

\ **Speed**\ : When making a full-attack action, the wielder of a \ *speed weapon*\  may make one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielder's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\  spell.)

Moderate transmutation\ *;*\ CL 7th; :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , :ref:`haste <corerulebook.spells.haste#haste>`\ ; Price +3 bonus.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#spell_storing`:

\ **Spell Storing**\ : A \ *spell storing weapon*\  allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled \ *spell storing weapon*\  has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it already.

Strong evocation (plus aura of stored spell)\ *;*\ CL 12th; :ref:`Craft Magic Arms and Armor <corerulebook.feats#craft_magic_arms_and_armor>`\ , creator must be a caster of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.

\ **Thundering**\ : A \ *thundering weapon*\  creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. A \ *thundering weapon*\  deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Subjects dealt critical hits by a \ *thundering weapon*\  must make a DC 14 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save or be :ref:`deafened <corerulebook.glossary#deafened>`\  permanently.

\ **Unholy**\ : An \ *unholy weapon*\  is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding :ref:`damage reduction <corerulebook.glossary#damage_reduction>`\ . It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of good alignment. It bestows one permanent :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ on any good creature attempting to wield it. The :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#vicious`:

\ **Vicious**\ : When a \ *vicious weapon*\  strikes an opponent, it creates a flash of disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the wielder. This energy deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to the opponent and 1d6 points of damage to the wielder. Only melee weapons can be \ *vicious*\ .

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#vorpal`:

\ **Vorpal**\ : This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. A \ *vorpal weapon*\  must be a slashing melee weapon. If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.

.. _`corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#wounding`:

\ **Wounding**\ : A \ *wounding weapon*\  deals 1 point of :ref:`bleed <corerulebook.glossary#bleed>`\  damage when it hits a creature. Multiple hits from a wounding weapon increase the :ref:`bleed <corerulebook.glossary#bleed>`\  damage. Bleeding creatures take the :ref:`bleed <corerulebook.glossary#bleed>`\  damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage. A critical hit does not multiply the :ref:`bleed <corerulebook.glossary#bleed>`\  damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the :ref:`bleed <corerulebook.glossary#bleed>`\  damage dealt by this weapon.

DESCRIPTION

This weapon usually appears to be a particularly frightening-looking iron or steel mace. On command, this \ *+2 heavy mace*\  causes the wielder's clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become :ref:`panicked <corerulebook.glossary#panicked>`\  as if by a :ref:`fear <corerulebook.spells.fear#fear>`\  spell (:ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  DC 16 partial).

DESCRIPTION
============

This longsword always performs as a \ *+2 longsword*\ , but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple \ *+2 longsword*\  (with a faint evil aura). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword's death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ . These :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\  never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including \ *restoration*\  spells) while the sword is wielded.

DESCRIPTION
============

Of elven make, this white \ *+2 composite longbow*\  (+2 :ref:`Str <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  bonus) whispers, "Swift defeat to my enemies" in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the archer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow's whisper becomes the shout "Death to those who have wronged me!" Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and ×4 on a critical hit instead of the normal ×3). After an enemy has been sworn, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the archer takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the \ *oathbow*\ . These bonuses and penalties last for 7 days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the \ *oathbow*\ , whichever comes first.

The \ *oathbow*\  may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or 7 days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the \ *oathbow's*\  special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.

==========

\ **Slot**\  none; \ **Price**\  50,335 gp; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.

DESCRIPTION
============

This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a \ *sun blade*\  is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a \ *sun blade*\ . Likewise, :ref:`Weapon Focus <corerulebook.feats#weapon_focus>`\  and :ref:`Weapon Specialization <corerulebook.feats#weapon_specialization>`\  in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.

In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a \ *+2 bastard sword*\ . Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and ×3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ×2).

The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The \ *sun blade*\  then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All \ *sun blades*\  are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ cannot be overcome in any way (including by \ *restoration*\  spells) while the sword is wielded.
