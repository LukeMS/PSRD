Make Whole
===========

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one object of up to 10 cu. ft./level or one construct creature of any size

This spell functions as :ref:`mending <corerulebook.spells.mending>`\ , except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on an object or construct creature (maximum 5d6).

\ *Make whole*\  can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When \ *make whole*\  is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\ .
