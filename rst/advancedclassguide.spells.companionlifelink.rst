Companion Life Link
====================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Component**\  V, S, M/DF (a drop of eidolon ichor)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  one of your animal companions or your familiar

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (see text)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

You create a life link between yourself and the target. You sense whenever the target is wounded and are made immediately aware if the target is slain. If you are wounded or slain, the target is made aware. As a free action, you can call out to the target, causing it to return to you (if able and willing); doing this ends the spell.
