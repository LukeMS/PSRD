Shock Shield
=============

\ **School**\  abjuration [electricity, force]; \ **Level**\  alchemist 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S 

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 minutes/level (D)

 This spell creates an invisible shield similar to but not as strong as the :ref:`shield <corerulebook.spells.shield#shield>`\  spell. This shield hovers in front of you and negates :ref:`magic missile <corerulebook.spells.magicmissile#magic_missile>`\  attacks directed at you. The disk provides a +2 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks. 

At any time, as a free action, you may dismiss your shield, at which point it deals 1d6 points of electrical damage to all creatures within a 5-foot burst, including you. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage.
