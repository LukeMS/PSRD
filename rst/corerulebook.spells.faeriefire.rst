A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by \ *faerie fire*\  take a â€“20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical \ *darkness*\ effect functions normally), :ref:`blur <corerulebook.spells.blur#blur>`\ , :ref:`displacement <corerulebook.spells.displacement#displacement>`\ , :ref:`invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility>`\ , or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The \ *faerie fire*\ can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The \ *faerie fire*\ does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
