Knock
======

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\ medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one door, box, or chest with an area of up to 10 sq. ft./level

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous; see text

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  no

\ *Knock*\ opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to :ref:`hold portal <corerulebook.spells.holdportal#hold_portal>`\  or :ref:`arcane lock <corerulebook.spells.arcanelock#arcane_lock>`\ . When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, \ *knock*\ opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an :ref:`arcane lock <corerulebook.spells.arcanelock#arcane_lock>`\ ed door, the spell does not remove the :ref:`arcane lock <corerulebook.spells.arcanelock#arcane_lock>`\  but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. \ *Knock*\ does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.
