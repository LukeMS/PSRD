Wondrous Items
###############

Wondrous items are diverse. Some must be worn in a specific magic item slot in order to work, while others must merely be possessed and utilized. "Wondrous item" is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into other groups such as weapons, staves, and so on. Anyone can use a wondrous item, unless the item specifies otherwise.

There are two main categories of wondrous items: slotted and slotless. Slotted items take up a magic item slot, and must be worn by those who want to benefit from them.

Amulet of the Blooded
======================

\ **Price**\  Varies

\ **Aberrant**\  15,000 GP; \ **Abyssal**\  12,000 GP; \ **Accursed**\  12,000 GP; \ **Celestial**\  12,000 GP; \ **Destined**\  10,000 GP; \ **Draconic**\  12,000 GP; \ **Elemental**\  12,000 GP; \ **Fey**\  10,000 GP; \ **Infernal**\  12,000 GP; \ **Undead**\  12,000 GP

\ **Slot**\  neck; \ **CL**\  varies; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  varies

Each different type of \ *amulet of the blooded*\  grants its wearer powers from one sorcerer bloodline, but makes him vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with the appropriate bloodline (such as a \ *blood-hunting*\  weapon). If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers.

\ *Aberrant*\ : This chunk of pitch-black onyx is suspended on a chain of silver. Strange whorls and tentacle-like shapes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a 25% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack (as the :ref:`light <corerulebook.spells.light#light>`\  :ref:`fortification <corerulebook.magicitems.armor#armor_fortification>`\  armor special ability). When making a melee touch attack, the wearer's reach increases by 5 feet. Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`blur <corerulebook.spells.blur#blur>`\ , :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\ .

\ *Abyssal*\ : This amulet is a chunk of bright red garnet in which fire seems to dance when light plays across its surface. It hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer gains electricity resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison. In addition, the wearer can grow claws as a free action. The claws are treated as natural weapons, and allows the wearer to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using his full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if the wearer is Small) plus the wearer's Strength modifier. Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`delay poison <corerulebook.spells.delaypoison#delay_poison>`\ , :ref:`magic fang <corerulebook.spells.magicfang#magic_fang>`\ , :ref:`resist energy <corerulebook.spells.resistenergy#resist_energy>`\ .

\ *Accursed*\ : This swirling green malachite hangs from a chain of oxidized copper. Sinister, unblinking eyes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm, cold, fear, fire, and sleep effects. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can fix his gaze on any one creature within 60 feet. The target becomes staggered for 4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 18). Only one target can be affected by the wearer's gaze at a time; if the wearer attempts to stagger a new opponent, the previous target immediately recovers whether the new attempt is successful or not. Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`bestow curse <corerulebook.spells.bestowcurse#bestow_curse>`\ , :ref:`resist energy <corerulebook.spells.resistenergy#resist_energy>`\ , :ref:`resistance <corerulebook.spells.resistance#resistance>`\ .

\ *Celestial*\ : This large, polished opal hangs from a chain of smoky gray steel. The wearer gains acid resistance 5 and cold resistance 5. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a ranged touch attack, targeting any foe within 30 feet. Against evil creatures, the ray deals 1d4+4 points of damage. The damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. The ray heals good creatures of 1d4+4 points of damage, but a good creature cannot benefit from the heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are unaffected by the ray. Moderate abjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`resist energy <corerulebook.spells.resistenergy#resist_energy>`\ , :ref:`scorching ray <corerulebook.spells.scorchingray#scorching_ray>`\ .

\ *Destined*\ : This chunk of uncut quartz hangs on a platinum chain. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws and to AC during surprise rounds or any time he is otherwise unaware of an attack. Once per day, the wearer can reroll one attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, or caster level check to overcome spell resistance. He must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the result is revealed. He must take the second result, even if it's lower. Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`aid <corerulebook.spells.aid#aid>`\ .

\ *Draconic*\ : This amulet comes in a variety of minerals depending on its powers, as shown in the table below, and is formed into the shape of a dragon's scale. The wearer gains resistance 5 against the energy type shown in the table, as well as a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can produce a breath weapon. This breath weapon deals 4d6 points of damage of the energy type and shape listed (Reflex DC 13 half). Moderate abjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`fire breath <advancedplayersguide.spells.firebreath#fire_breath>`\ , :ref:`resist energy <corerulebook.spells.resistenergy#resist_energy>`\ .

Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can unleash a blast of elemental power. This 20-foot-radius burst deals 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 14 half) of the energy type listed.

\ *Fey*\ : This drop of amber hangs on a silk cord. The wearer can turn invisible for 9 rounds per day (as :ref:`greater invisibility <corerulebook.spells.invisibility#invisibility_greater>`\ ). The rounds don't need to be consecutive. Three times per day, the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to burst out laughing. That creature can take only a move action, but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by this laughter, it is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

\ *Infernal*\ : This chunk of black marble hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer gains fire resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison.

\ **Slot**\  neck; \ **CL**\  varies; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  varies

Each different type of \ *amulet of the spirit*\  grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a \ *spirit-hunting weapon*\ ). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers.

\ *Battle*\ : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`bestow curse <corerulebook.spells.bestowcurse#bestow_curse>`\ , :ref:`entropic shield <corerulebook.spells.entropicshield#entropic_shield>`\ .

\ *Bones*\ : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to AC for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`entropic shield <corerulebook.spells.entropicshield#entropic_shield>`\ , :ref:`scare <corerulebook.spells.scare#scare>`\ .

\ *Flame*\ : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`burning hands <corerulebook.spells.burninghands#burning_hands>`\ .

\ *Heavens*\ : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`darkness <corerulebook.spells.darkness#darkness>`\ , :ref:`locate creature <corerulebook.spells.locatecreature#locate_creature>`\ .

\ *Life*\ : This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`cure light wounds <corerulebook.spells.curelightwounds#cure_light_wounds>`\ , :ref:`inflict moderate wounds <corerulebook.spells.inflictmoderatewounds#inflict_moderate_wounds>`\ .

\ *Stone*\ : This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a –4 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`heat metal <corerulebook.spells.heatmetal#heat_metal>`\ , :ref:`stoneskin <corerulebook.spells.stoneskin#stoneskin>`\ .

\ *Waves*\ : This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the :ref:`blur <corerulebook.spells.blur#blur>`\  spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, :ref:`blur <corerulebook.spells.blur#blur>`\ , :ref:`chill touch <corerulebook.spells.chilltouch#chill_touch>`\ .

\ *Wind*\ : This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

Once per day when the banner is planted firmly in the ground, it creates a calm and comfortable environment in a 20-foot radius from the banner, granting those within the area the benefits of :ref:`endure elements <corerulebook.spells.endureelements#endure_elements>`\ . This area of calm and comfort can even resist magical weather effects, but only if those effects are of a caster level lower than that of the banner.

Also, the banner wards the area of calm and comfort as if by an :ref:`alarm <corerulebook.spells.alarm#alarm>`\  spell (audible alarm).

This ancient bronze hand bell has an ivory handle, and simple pictograms of animals are etched onto its exterior. Once per day on command, the user can ring the bell to summon his familiar to his side, as long as the familiar is within 100 feet of the user. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the user's level. The familiar immediately appears in a space of the user's choice adjacent to him.

If the user's familiar is dead, this ability can be used summon its spirit back from beyond the grave. This functions as a :ref:`raise dead <corerulebook.spells.raisedead#raise_dead>`\  spell, but can target only the user's familiar. The familiar doesn't need to be touched to accomplish this, though it must be within 100 feet. Any negative levels the familiar gains as a result of being raised are automatically removed at the rate of 1 per day, and any lost Constitution is automatically restored at the rate of 1 point per day. Once the bell has been used to raise a familiar, it transforms into inert clay and loses all of its magic abilities.

This diminutive, shiny brass construct looks like a spider made of gears and cogs. It's roughly the size of an adult human's hand, and its legs are all picks, chisels, pliers, and other tools of fine manipulation. Its body contains reservoirs of powders and oils it can spray 2 inches out of its nozzle-spinnerets. A fine chain can be played out of a winch on the brass spider's back, connecting it to a small disk with studs and levers that control the construct's actions, enabling it to walk and crawl like a spider. It has no autonomous motivation.

Once per day, a character holding the \ *brass spider*\ 's chain can use the :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  skill from 15 feet away without penalty, though he must have line of sight to the device he is attempting to disable. In most cases, this means any mishap caused by the skill affects the \ *brass spider*\  (which has hardness 5 and 25 hit points) rather than the spider's controller.

Cups of Rapport
================

\ **Price**\  8,000 gp; \ **Slot**\ none; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb. (pair); \ **Aura**\  faint enchantment

These wooden drinking cups are similar to those found in many common taverns, and always come in pairs—one is a master cup, and the other is a mark cup. When a user of the master cup shares drinks with someone with the mark cup, the master cup's user gains a supernatural advantage when attempting to develop a good rapport with the creature drinking from the mark cup. After 5 minutes of sharing a drink and chatting with a user of the mark cup, the user of the master cup gains a +5 bonus on :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ , :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , and :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks against the user of the mark cup. The two users must share a beverage from a common source (for example, two cupfuls poured from a single bottle of wine, ladled from the same punch bowl, or dipped into the same spring water) and spend the 5 minutes socializing with one another. The bonus lasts for 1 hour or until the users move more than 15 feet apart from each other, whichever comes first. Once a creature has used a mark cup, that creature cannot be affected by the same mark cup for 1 day.

This leather collar resizes to fit almost any size of creature. Once per day on command, the creature that fastened the dire collar to the animal can cause that animal to grow larger and more bestial. The collar's fastener must be within 30 feet of the animal to do so.

This drinking horn is made from the highly polished tusk of some great beast. Etched around the rim are stylized waves and sea creatures. The horn typically appears empty, but once per day a creature holding it can command it to fill with a liquid that has the effect of one of four spells when consumed: :ref:`cure serious wounds <corerulebook.spells.cureseriouswounds#cure_serious_wounds>`\ , :ref:`neutralize poison <corerulebook.spells.neutralizepoison#neutralize_poison>`\ , :ref:`remove disease <corerulebook.spells.removedisease#remove_disease>`\ , or :ref:`lesser restoration <corerulebook.spells.restoration#restoration_lesser>`\ . Consuming a drink from the horn is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. No matter the spell chosen, the drink in the horn has the appearance and honeyed fragrance of summer mead.

Elixir of Sex Shift

\ **Price**\  2,250 gp; \ **Slot**\ none; \ **CL**\  9th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

Upon drinking this elixir, a character permanently transforms their biology to take on a different set of sexual characteristics of their choice. While the imbiberâs physiology changes dramatically and their features adjust slightly to take on the new qualities, the imbiber is still recognizable as the same person. The character has only minor control over the specific details of this new appearance, and the elixir grants no benefit on Disguise skill checks or similar checks.

This elixirâs magic functions instantaneously and canât be dispelled, though drinking a second \ *elixir of sex shift*\  either reverts the character back to a former form or allows them to adopt alternate sexual characteristics, as they choose. The elixir has no effect on characters who are pregnant or are of races with no sexual differentiation. Most races have a wide spectrum of sexual differentiation, some common, others more rare. Therefore, most creatures can decide how this elixir transforms them. An unwilling imbiber can choose not to change at all.

These ruddy leather gloves enhance the precision of the wearer. When wielding a piercing or slashing weapon and using Weapon Finesse, the wearer can mark a creature when confirming a critical hit instead of dealing additional damage. The mark consists of a simple symbol, such as a single letter.

The wielder and her allies gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against the marked creature for 1 minute. In addition, the marked creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the wielder's level + the wielder's Dexterity modifier) or be shaken for 1 minute.

Hunter's Tree fort
===================

\ **Price**\  10,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  noneCL 7th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

This item appears to be a wooden puzzle box approximately 3 inches on a side. When the box is placed on the ground beneath the boughs of a tree with a trunk at least 2 feet in diameter and the command word is spoken, the box unfolds and rises, melding with the tree. It becomes a stable structure attached to the limbs 20 feet above ground level, with a rope ladder hanging down from a trapdoor on the underside of the platform. The outer surfaces of the tree fort take on the visual characteristics of the tree in which it is erected, and require a DC 25 :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  check to notice (DC 15 in a dead tree or tree that has shed its leaves). There are two forms the tree fort can take, chosen at the time the device is activated.

\ *Tree House*\ : This version of the tree fort unfolds into a 20-foot-square, open-air platform with railings on all four sides but no roof. It is open to the elements and provides no protection from the weather, but it has enough convenient braces and knotholes to allow tents to be erected across its surface. Creatures standing in the tree house gain the benefits of partial cover against opponents on the ground, while those who are prone within it have total cover.

\ *Blind*\ : This version of the tree fort forms into a 5-foot-square hunting blind. It is enclosed on all sides, has a roof, and is equipped with a number of narrow horizontal windows for watching or shooting from any side. Creatures inside the blind have improved cover against all foes outside.

In either form, a \ *hunter's tree fort*\  remains open for up to 12 hours in any 24-hour period; these hours of use don't need to be consecutive. If the duration expires while the tree fort is occupied or the tree fort takes 50 points of damage (hardness 5), the fort descends and folds itself back up into its puzzle box form, leaving all inhabitants unharmed on the ground at the base of the tree. If the tree fort was forced to return to box form due to damage, it can't be activated again for 24 hours.

This long-stemmed, wooden pipe can burn any number of substances, but is primarily used for smoking tobacco. The pipe smoker can command a small, smoky servant to emerge from the pipe to do minor tasks. The servant can move or fetch small objects, and in general acts as an :ref:`unseen servant <corerulebook.spells.unseenservant#unseen_servant>`\ , except that it is visible as a small, wispy cloud of gray smoke. Additionally, the servant is capable of clearing one 5-foot square of smoke or fog per round. The servant can be used for up to 1 hour per day; this time doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 10-minute increments. 

An investigator gains some additional benefits while smoking the pipe. He can use inspiration on :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  checks to track or :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks to notice fine details without spending a use of inspiration.

\ **Price**\  46,000 gp; \ **Slot**\ neck; \ **CL**\  11th; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate transmutation

This grotesque collar is useful to any witch who is eager to form a coven, but would rather avoid associating with one or more evil hags. The collar is a crude band of iron from which hang the fist-sized shrunken heads of three hags (an annis hag\ :sup:`B3`\ , a green hag, and a sea hag). The heads remain semi-animate—they occasionally twitch, blink, coo softly, or whisper curses at the wearer, each other, or anyone else nearby. A witch with the coven hex who wears the collar gains access to the following powers.

:ref:`Champion <advancedplayersguide.magicitems.armor#champion>`\  of the Unbound Coven: If the wearer joins a coven, the coven can ignore the requirement to have at least one hag as a member. Each of the coven members must still have the coven hex, and one of the members must be at least a 9th-level witch.

\ *Dreadful Gaze*\ : Three times per day as a swift action, the wearer can command the hags' heads to lock their terrible gazes on one humanoid within 30 feet. The target of this gaze attack must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become paralyzed with terror (as the effect of the :ref:`hold person <corerulebook.spells.holdperson#hold_person>`\  spell). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. 

\ *Hag Form*\ : Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can assume the form of a powerfully built Medium crone that resembles the horrific union of an annis hag, a green hag, and a sea hag. This metamorphosis is identical to the :ref:`transformation <corerulebook.spells.transformation#transformation>`\  spell, including the violent change to the wearer's mindset and the loss of spellcasting ability.

The lantern functions as a bullseye lantern but needs no oil to shed its light. If its command word is spoken, it begins to reveal magic auras as the :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\  spell. It will reveal all auras :ref:`detect magic <corerulebook.spells.detectmagic#detect_magic>`\  reveals over the normal duration of 3 rounds, as long as its light is held on the same area for this duration.

These amber lenses are shaped to look like the eyes of a cat. As a standard action, the wearer can use these lenses to target a single creature that he can see. When he does, as long as the target is not already the subject of the wearer's studied target class feature, the wearer gains a +1 bonus on :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ , :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\ , :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\ , :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\ , and :ref:`Survival <corerulebook.skills.survival#survival>`\  checks against that creature, along with a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls and damage rolls against it as if he had the studied target class feature. 

If the wearer has the studied target class feature, he can instead use the magic of these lenses as a free action when designating the subject of his studied target to increase his effective slayer level by 5 for the purposes of the studied target class feature.

When not in use, this magical device appears to be a simple wooden picture frame about 3 inches by 5 inches in size. However, when set against a solid surface, it becomes a window, allowing the user to see through to the other side. No visible evidence of the window appears on the opposite side of the wall or door where it is used. No items, light, sound, spells, or spell effects can pass through the window, and divination magic that allows the user to penetrate illusions or spot hidden things (such as :ref:`true seeing <corerulebook.spells.trueseeing#true_seeing>`\ ) does not function. If there is no ambient light in the area being viewed, it appears as complete darkness to the viewer. The one-way window can penetrate up to 1 foot of wood, 6 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal, but even a thin layer of lead blocks the effect. If the surface to be looked through is too thick, the frame simply doesn't function.

Preyfinder
===========

\ **Price**\  85,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  noneCL 9th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  moderate divination

These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though \ *preyfinders*\  function as standard compasses, making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures.

To use a \ *preyfinder*\ , its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the \ *preyfinder's*\  tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the \ *preyfinder*\  can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the \ *preyfinder's*\  magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the \ *preyfinder*\  telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the \ *preyfinder's*\  quarry. 

After a creature is marked as the \ *preyfinder's*\  quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the \ *preyfinder*\  provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by :ref:`mislead <corerulebook.spells.mislead#mislead>`\ , :ref:`nondetection <corerulebook.spells.nondetection#nondetection>`\ , and :ref:`polymorph <corerulebook.spells.polymorph#polymorph>`\  spells and effects.

A \ *preyfinder*\  can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the \ *preyfinder*\ .

When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a \ *preyfinder*\  grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the \ *preyfinder's*\  quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the \ *preyfinder*\  (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood to the \ *preyfinder*\ , none of the \ *preyfinder's*\  magical powers functions for 24 hours.

Whistle of Calling
===================

\ **Price**\  6,300 gp; \ **Slot**\ none; \ **CL**\  7th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  moderate conjuration

This whistle emits a loud, shrill note. Once per day when the user blows this whistle his mount or animal companion is instantly teleported to a safe space of the user's choice that's within 30 feet of him. The creature must be within 1 mile, and any effect that bars or hampers \ *teleportation*\  also impedes this effect. The whistle is useless unless attuned to a specific mount or animal companion; attuning the whistle is a special ritual that takes 10 minutes. The whistle can be attuned to a new mount or animal companion at will.
