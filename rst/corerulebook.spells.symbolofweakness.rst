Symbol of Weakness
===================

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that every creature within 60 feet of a \ *symbol of weakness*\ instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  damage.

Unlike :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , \ *symbol of weakness*\ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \ *symbol of weakness*\ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.

\ *Note*\ : Magic traps such as \ *symbol of weakness*\ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for \ *symbol of weakness*\ .
