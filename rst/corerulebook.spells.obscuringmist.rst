A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including :ref:`darkvision <corerulebook.glossary#darkvision>`\ , beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a :ref:`gust of wind <corerulebook.spells.gustofwind#gust_of_wind>`\  spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\ , :ref:`flame strike <corerulebook.spells.flamestrike#flame_strike>`\ , or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A :ref:`wall of fire <corerulebook.spells.walloffire#wall_of_fire>`\  burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.
