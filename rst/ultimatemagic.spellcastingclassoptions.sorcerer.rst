Sorcerer
*********

Sorcerous power is, by its very nature, a strange and unpredictable thing, the result of mysterious magical heritages and the intermingling of creatures both legendary and mundane. With the magical legacies flowing through their veins, sorcerers can undertake great works capable of placing them forever in the halls of heroes—or laying waste to all around them. 

The following section introduces new sorcerer bloodlines, as well as two new sorcerer archetypes—crossblooded and wildblooded—the latter of which comes with its own unique selection of modified bloodlines to reflect its bizarre and mutated origins.

Accursed
*********

Misfortune, pestilence, and nightmares follow your family like vermin drawn to carrion. Somewhere in your family history, a hag's foul influence entered your bloodline. You may actually be related to the hag, or you may still be suffering the effects of a curse that a hag laid upon your kin in generations past. Now the hag's powers are part of your heritage.

Maestro
********

The spiritual power of art and song runs strongly through your family line. This may be the result of ancient pacts made with azata patrons, or even an inheritance from a lillend or trumpet archon ancestor. It could also be the lingering taint of a less savory heritage, such as from a harpy or a forefather driven to madness by the disquieting gibbering of a shoggoth. However it came to be, your family's artistic bent shows itself strongly in your magic.

\ **Class Skill**\ : :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\ .

Rakshasa
*********

At some point in your family's history, one of your ancestors was tainted by the influence of a rakshasa. Though most of your family seem entirely normal, you have always felt your own skin is a prison from which magic allows you to escape. Your birthright is a secret you may be forced to keep from societies that would never deal with you if your heritage were known.

\ **Bloodline Arcana**\ : Add half your sorcerer level to the :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  DC for others to identify spells you cast. If their checks fail by 5 or more, they mistakenly believe you are casting an entirely different spell (selected by you when you begin casting).

\ **Bloodline Powers**\ : You can call upon the nearly divine power of your rakshasa ancestors, giving you the power to convincingly deceive your enemies.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#silver_tongue`:

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your sorcerer level) to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#mind_reader`:

\ *Mind Reader (Sp)*\ : At 3rd level, you can read minds as a spell-like ability. This ability acts like :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts#detect_thoughts>`\ , except it lasts only 1 round, you use it on a single target as a standard action, and if the target fails its Will save, you gain information as if you had concentrated on it for 3 rounds. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 20th level.

\ *Alter Self (Sp)*\ : At 15th level, you can change your shape into that of any humanoid at will. This ability acts like :ref:`alter self <corerulebook.spells.alterself#alter_self>`\ , except you may remain in a chosen form as long as you want. 

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#outsider`:

\ *Outsider (Su)*\ : At 20th level, your natural form becomes an animal-headed humanoid, like a true rakshasa. This does not affect your ability to speak or cast spells. You can use your :ref:`alter self <corerulebook.spells.alterself#alter_self>`\  or other disguise and polymorph abilities to assume your original form or other forms when it suits you. You are forevermore treated as a native outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever your original type was) for the purpose of spells and other magical effects. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. You gain DR 10/piercing.

\ **Bloodline Arcana**\ : Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to acid. This effect also changes the spell's descriptors to match this energy type.

\ **Bloodline Powers**\ : Like a shaitan, you have both natural power over earth, and several other genie-based abilities.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#acid_ray`:

\ *Acid Ray (Sp)*\ : Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Elemental :ref:`Resistance <corerulebook.spells.resistance#resistance>`\  (Ex): At 3rd level, you gain acid resistance 10. At 9th level, your acid resistance increases to 20.

Once per day, you can cast :ref:`limited wish <corerulebook.spells.limitedwish#limited_wish>`\  as a spell-like ability. Such wishes must begin with the words "I wish," and cannot duplicate a wish you have granted within the past 24 hours. If you use this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly material component, you must provide that component.

You become immune to acid damage, and can use :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\  once per day to travel to or from the Plane of Earth.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#crossblooded_(archetype)`:

Crossblooded (Archetype)
#########################

A crossblooded bloodline combines the powers of two distinct heritages. In most cases, sorcerers with this bloodline are the offspring of two sorcerers from different ancestries, but occasionally a crossblooded sorcerer arises from the conjunction of other powers. A draconic sorcerer who is also the culmination of a great destiny, an abyssal sorcerer from a family that dealt with devils, and an arcane sorcerer raised from birth by fey are all possible sources for crossblooded bloodlines.

A crossblooded sorcerer selects two different bloodlines. The sorcerer may gain access to the skills, feats, and some of the powers of both bloodlines she is descended from, but at the cost of reduced mental clarity and choice (see Drawbacks).

\ **Class Skill**\ : A crossblooded sorcerer receives the bonus class skill from both of her bloodlines. If these are the same skill, this does not grant any additional benefit.

\ **Bonus Spells**\ : A crossblooded sorcerer may select her bonus spells from either of her bloodlines. The sorcerer also has the choice to learn a lower-level bonus spell she did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell she would normally gain. Lower-level bonus spells learned this way always use the spell level that they would be if the sorcerer had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#example`:

\ *Example*\ : A 3rd-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded sorcerer has the choice of learning :ref:`cause fear <corerulebook.spells.causefear#cause_fear>`\  or :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  as her bloodline bonus spell. If she selected :ref:`cause fear <corerulebook.spells.causefear#cause_fear>`\  as her 3rd-level bonus spell, at 5th level she could use her new bonus spell to learn :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  instead of :ref:`bull's strength <corerulebook.spells.bullsstrength#bull_s_strength>`\  or :ref:`see invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\ , and she would add it to her list of 1st-level spells known (just as if she had learned it as her 3rd-level bonus spell).

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#bonus_feat`:

\ **Bonus Feat**\ : A crossblooded sorcerer combines the bonus feat lists from both of her bloodlines and may select her bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.

\ **Bloodline Arcana**\ : A crossblooded sorcerer gains the bloodline arcana of both her bloodlines.

\ **Bloodline Powers**\ : At 1st, 3rd, 9th, 15th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded sorcerer gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to her at that level. She may instead select a lower-level bloodline power she did not choose in place of one of these higher-level powers.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#drawbacks`:

\ **Drawbacks**\ : A crossblooded sorcerer has one fewer spell known at each level (including cantrips) than is presented on the :ref:`sorcerer spells known table <corerulebook.classes.sorcerer#table_3_15_sorcerer_spells_known>`\ . Furthermore, the conflicting urges created by the divergent nature of the crossblooded sorcerer's dual heritage forces her to constantly take some mental effort just to remain focused on her current situation and needs. This leaves her with less mental resolve to deal with external threats. A crossblooded sorcerer always takes a –2 penalty on Will saves.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#wildblooded_(archetype)`:

Wildblooded (Archetype)
########################

A wildblooded sorcerer has a mutated version of a more common bloodline, with one arcana and at least one bloodline power that are different from those of an unmutated bloodline. When creating a wildblooded sorcerer, select an existing bloodline, then select one of the following mutated bloodlines associated with that bloodline. Use the normal bloodline's class skill, bonus spells, and bonus feats, and the mutated bloodline's bloodline arcana. Use the normal bloodline's bloodline powers, except when the mutated bloodline replaces one of those powers.

\ **Bloodline Powers**\ : Raw magical energy lashes out when you destroy or negate hostile spells.

.. _`ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.sorcerer#wild_feedback`:

You gain a +2 bonus on all :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  and :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (religion) checks.
