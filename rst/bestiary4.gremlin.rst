Special Abilities
==================

\ **Gremlin Lice (Ex)**\ All grimples are infested with gremlin lice. Whenever a warm-blooded creature comes in physical contact with a grimple, there is a 25% chance it contracts gremlin lice. 1d4 rounds later, the creature begins to itch. The itch proves so distracting that for the duration of the infestation, the individual takes a â1 penalty on all concentration and initiative checks. Fortunately, these annoying parasites cannot live long on non-gremlins, and only survive for 24 hours. Submersion in water or exposure to freezing temperatures also kills a gremlin lice infestation.

\ **Putrid Vomit (Ex)**\  Every 1d4 rounds, a grimple can spew a 30-foot line of vomit as a standard action. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Anyone struck must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Grimples are filthy urban scavengers that lurk beneath the eaves of abandoned buildings, clock towers, belfries, and steeples. Sickly-looking and ragged, they shed constantly as a result of the small parasites they host. Quick climbers, grimples also have loose flaps of skin that stretch between their arms and allow them to glide short distances.

Grimples despise humans and show it by attacking drunks, unlocking stables, torturing guard dogs, and loosening hanging storefront signs so that they fall on people. This does not stop them from sometimes allying with humans and other humanoids, but such collaborations are always temporary, as a grimple is ever plotting betrayal. Although a grimple is often arrogant and overbearing, its ability to vomit at will (and propensity for doing so constantly) remains its most unappealing quality.

Voracious omnivores, grimples feast off garbage. They frequently target inns, restaurants, and other places where they can scavenge a steady supply of food.

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Misplacement (Su)**\  Hanivers are swift and curious, possessing an uncanny ability to meddle with the possessions of any character whose square they enter. Any time a haniver succeeds at a :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\  check against a creature, it also rearranges that creature's possessions. The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item, it finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged; retrieving a stored item or drawing a weapon then requires a standard action instead of a move action (unless the haniver has stolen the item in question). After spending this standard action, the character takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability.

Occasionally, hanivers replace items they've stolen or leave their old treasures—seashells, old fish, clumps of sand—in containers or clothing they have rooted through. They do this without any added difficultly to their :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\  checks.

Haniver gremlins haunt the stories of sailors and fishing communities, featuring prominently in parables told to naughty children by disapproving parents. A thousand such tales exist, each a variation on a common theme—the gremlins flap up from the sea, startle nasty fishermen or disobedient youths, and make off with their trinkets. Yet as is rarely the case with such tales, nearly every word of these stories—no matter how unlikely or comic—proves near to the truth.

Strange, capricious fey creatures that enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping over solitary horseshoe crabs, and suicidally teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat. Should they like what they find, they typically attempt to make off with it, clinging to their prize like a beloved heirloom until the next curiosity or shiny treasure catches their attention. Hanivers have no concept of worth, though they know much of desirability, and might hang onto an item they would otherwise discard in moments if another creature—or former owner—expresses desire for it. The gremlins don't steal out of any sense of maliciousness, but rather out of curiosity and selfishness. The most intelligent occasionally even believe that they're trading, and leave behind old "treasures"—often strange or natural items that barely fit the description—in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it—hence the tendency of sailors to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing.

Hanivers possess flat, leathery bodies with only a few thin bones. Most stand little more than a foot tall and 1-1/2 feet across, and weigh less than 5 pounds.

\ **Treasure**\  double (always gold coins)

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Magic Bag (Su)**\  A monaciello always carries its pouch with it. This pouch contains an extradimensional space and operates like a \ *bag*\  \ *of*\  \ *holding*\ (type I). If this pouch is separated from the monaciello, all of its former contents are lost, and it becomes a normal bag that contains a number of coins equal to double the treasure value of a creature of the gremlin's CR. A monaciello that loses its pouch must create a new one, a process that takes 1d4 days. Until the new pouch is finished, it remains a non-magical bag, only becoming a fully functional extradimensional space once completed.

\ **Stymie Channeling (Su)**\  A monaciello gremlin is surrounded by an aura of blasphemy. Any creatures channeling energy within 20 feet of a monaciello must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be unable to channel for that round. The use is not lost, but the action is wasted.

Most often found in urban environments, this gremlin lives among humanity, taunting religious and scholarly organizations with its pranks. Monaciello gremlins are most commonly found in monasteries and cathedrals where they wriggle their way up from the sewers and catacombs to play tricks on the devout.

These tricksters pull blankets off sleeping clergy members, harass servants, spoil food, and hide valuables from their owners. Enamored with gold, they often overinflate the value of things with illusions, and even throw handfuls of gold coins (or illusions of gold coins if they are feeling especially stingy) to distract creatures on their trail. They pull these coins from their ever-present magical bags, confident they can always pilfer more.

A monaciello stands 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs approximately 20 pounds.
