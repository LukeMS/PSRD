A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a :ref:`wall of force <corerulebook.spells.wallofforce#wall_of_force>`\ , except that it can be negated by :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ . A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.
