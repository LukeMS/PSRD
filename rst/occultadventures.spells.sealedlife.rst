Sealed Life
============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  medium 2, spiritualist 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  S

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  none; \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes

You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its vitality with others. Affected creatures can't transfer damage to or from another, such as through :ref:`shield other <corerulebook.spells.shieldother#shield_other>`\ , a spiritualist's life bond, or a summoner's life link. Effects such as :ref:`vampiric touch <corerulebook.spells.vampirictouch#vampiric_touch>`\  that steal vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no benefits.

Sealed Life, Greater
=====================

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  spiritualist 6

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level

This spell functions as \ *sealed life*\ , except it additionally provides the benefits of :ref:`death ward <corerulebook.spells.deathward#death_ward>`\  and renders its targets immune to effects that extract or transfer its soul, such as :ref:`possession <occultadventures.spells.possession#possession>`\  and :ref:`trap the soul <corerulebook.spells.trapthesoul#trap_the_soul>`\ . This spell prevents a soul from returning to its body if it has already departed, until the spell's duration expires.
