Command
========

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 1

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one living creature

\ **Duration**\  1 round

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

\ *Approach*\ : On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

\ *Drop*\ : On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

\ *Fall*\ : On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains :ref:`prone <corerulebook.glossary#prone>`\  for 1 round. It may act normally while :ref:`prone <corerulebook.glossary#prone>`\  but takes any appropriate penalties.

\ *Flee*\ : On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

\ *Halt*\ : The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered :ref:`helpless <corerulebook.glossary#helpless>`\ .

If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

Command, Greater
=================

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 5 

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

This spell functions like :ref:`command <corerulebook.spells.command#command>`\ , except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
