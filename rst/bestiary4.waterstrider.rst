Special Abilities
==================

\ **Tremorsense (Ex)**\  A water strider's tremorsense functions only when the creature is in contact with the water's surface.

\ **Water Skating (Ex)**\  A water strider can move on the surface of water as if it were on land. A water strider swimming at the water's surface can pull itself onto the water with a successful :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  check.

A giant water strider is a long-legged insect with the ability to walk on water. It feeds on fish and birds. Water striders use their weak flight only to escape predators or for seasonal migrations to new breeding areas. They are sometimes kept as mounts by coast-dwelling humanoids. A giant water strider lives 1â2 years.

Carrying more than a light load (200 pounds) prevents a giant water strider from using its water skating ability.

A nymph water strider is an immature specimen of the giant water strider—more mature than a caterpillar but not yet an adult. Over the next several months it eats and molts, increasing in size with each molt until it becomes Large and is fully adult. These creatures are shy and more skittish than adults.

Lizardfolk hunt wild nymph water striders, and consider them a wonderful delicacy. Boggards and gripplis raise them as food animals, but something about the domestication process makes such nymphs unappealing to lizardfolk. In the wild they frantically flee other creatures that approach them, making them difficult to hunt or corral. Many boggard, lizardfolk, and grippli tribes consider capturing a live nymph a rite of passage to adulthood.

A nymph water strider isn't suitable as a mount for any Large or smaller creature.
