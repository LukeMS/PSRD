Sahuagin
*********

The sahuagin are horrid creatures that lurk in the oceans, ever ready to wreak devastation. These "sea devils" leave ships adrift and crewless, steal away whole villages in the dead of night, and force aquatic elves and merfolk alike to gird for war.

Sahuagin are complex beings. They have keen intellects and crave order and structure, yet they boil with barely suppressed rage and bloodlust. Even the smallest provocation can tip a sahuagin from cold and calculating schemer to murderous assailant. To stay sane and sharp in times of need, sahuagin periodically revel in bloodstained waters—those who can't satiate their bloodlust either retreat into lethargic apathy or snap and turn against their own.

As a people, sahuagin seek nothing less than total domination of the seas. Though they love to unleash doom on other intelligent species, sahuagin also live in perpetual war with their own kind. Their kings and queens encourage these petty blood feuds, seeing them as a means to feed the blood frenzy, control their numbers, and further hone their race's already considerable skills in battle.

Unlike most aquatic humanoids, sahuagin thrive at any depth or temperature. Even still, they show a marked preference for warm coastal waters—perhaps due to an abundance of both food and beings to terrorize. Sahuagin can be found anywhere from sheltered atolls to lightless trenches, from the tropics to the poles. They have even spread to the Elemental Plane of Water.

Sahuagin live under a feudal system that embodies a ruthless enforcement of order. Each sahuagin holds a position earned with its prowess and skills, and risks demotion by showing any sign of incompetence—or death for any sign of weakness. Officers and lords rule minor holdings as vassals to the barons, dukes, and princesses; kings and queens rule entire oceans from their grand palaces within cities boasting populations in the tens of thousands. Each noble sahuagin aspires to bend the others to her will and become the ruler of an oceanic empire, ushering in the inevitable age of sahuagin ascendance.

Despite their use of noble titles, sahuagin put little stock in bloodlines. Accomplishment trumps parentage, and while sahuagin take pride in relatives with influence and strength, even the offspring of royals must swim unaided. Certainly those children have more opportunities and training than others, but the ambitious daughter of a common laborer might rise to rule a barony, while the inept son of a baron could very well become the meal of his betters.

Sahuagin view other creatures through the lens of their appetites—other races live only to serve as slaves, to die in sport or battle, or to fill the belly. Sahuagin rarely ally with creatures other than their beloved sharks and the shark-like adaros, though they occasionally enslave dragon turtles and other fearsome aquatic monsters as beasts of war. They despise aquatic elves, locathahs, merfolk, and tritons, seeing them as weaklings fit only for slavery and feasting. Aboleths and krakens earn a mixture of loathing and respect, as these beings represent the greatest impediment to sahuagin dominion of the seas.

Young sahuagin are born into clutches of up to 200 eggs, which females lay in well-protected egg chambers. A single settlement typically has one chamber, but larger cities can have up to a dozen. Eggs hatch 3 months after being laid, spawning eel-like fingerlings—all teeth, jaws, and tail. Hatching provokes a violent frenzy, as the newborn fingerlings devour the smaller and weaker members of their clutch. A number of the survivors fall prey to larger predators, or are eaten by their larger siblings when they grow hungry again after their brutal first meal. Only the clever, fast, or strong survive long in the egg chambers.

Sahuagin parents return to claim their surviving young after a year has passed, recognizing their offspring by scent. Some young remain unclaimed, because their parents either have perished or cannot track down the scent. The sahuagin barracks raise such foundlings communally, thrusting them into battle as soon as they can wield a trident.

Sahuagin mature quickly. They develop arms and legs at 6 months of age, grow to around 5 feet tall within a year, and reach their adult size of 7 feet tall around their sixth year. Upon reaching maturity, sahuagin of low social standing must fend for themselves or die—those of higher status are often trained and protected long enough by their parents to become skilled and deadly warriors.

As a species, sahuagin are particularly prone to mutation. Most mutants perish in the hatcheries, but those that survive command early respect, their strange abilities seen as proof of divine favor. The most common are the fearsome four-armed sahuagin, perhaps accounting for one in 100 surviving hatchlings. Other mutations appear to arise due to environmental conditions or nearness to other species, or perhaps in response to trace contaminants in the water. Of particular note are the malenti, those sahuagin who for unknown reasons are born looking exactly like aquatic elves.

Sahuagin have long, possibly unlimited life spans, though violence claims most before they reach their thirtieth year. Some particularly fierce princes and queens have ruled for hundreds of years, however, as sahuagin's bodies don't decline with age. Particularly old sahuagin are significantly larger than their younger kin (growing into Large creatures as they age). Sahuagin of all ages despise infirmity, and attempt to excise it from their midst with atavistic, violent reactions.

Full statistics for sahuagin can be found in their :ref:`Bestiary entry <bestiary.sahuagin>`\ .

New Rules
##########

The following section details rules to help represent a wide range of sahuagin.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#sahuagin_mutants`:

Sahuagin Mutants
*****************

Inherent instability in sahuagin genes makes them susceptible to mutations. Not all these mutations are beneficial, and defective sahuagin rarely survive long after hatching. Sahuagin mutants that do survive and grow to adulthood command the respect and admiration of their peers, quickly rising to positions of power. Four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most common forms of mutated sahuagin.

\ **Four-Armed Sahuagin**\ : These mutants have four arms, giving them two additional claw attacks. Four-armed sahuagin gain :ref:`Multiattack <bestiary.monsterfeats#multiattack>`\  and :ref:`Toughness <corerulebook.feats#toughness>`\  as bonus feats, and gain the multiweapon mastery ability. They have a base CR of 3. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, and rangers.

\ **Malenti**\ : A malenti resembles an aquatic elf, and receives a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, gains Deceitful and :ref:`Skill Focus <corerulebook.feats#skill_focus>`\  (:ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ ) as bonus feats, and can use :ref:`command <corerulebook.spells.command#command>`\  as a spell-like ability three times per day (this ability works only on creatures with the aquatic subtype, representing increased telepathic influence over aquatic creatures). Additionally, a malenti's natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards.

\ **Prehistoric Sahuagin**\ : Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to a more savage epoch; they're Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with aquatic dinosaurs and aquatic megafauna in addition to sharks. Adacthys are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures.

\ **Shark-Blooded Sahuagin**\ : These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of shark-like teeth, as well as the fins and tail of an oversized shark. These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a base speed of 5 feet, a swim speed of 80 feet, a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and immunity to trip attempts. Shark-blooded sahuagin are typically found in sahuagin communities with an unusually high number of shark guardians or near shark breeding grounds.

\ **Sightless Sahuagin**\ : These pallid, sickly looking sahuagin lack eyes, but their blindsense increases to 90 feet and they gain :ref:`Blind Fight <corerulebook.feats#blind_fight>`\  as a bonus feat. A glowing tendril protruding from a sightless sahuagin causes all sighted creatures to be dazzled while within 10 feet of the sahuagin, and allows it to use :ref:`animal trance <corerulebook.spells.animaltrance#animal_trance>`\  once per day as a spell-like ability. This :ref:`animal trance <corerulebook.spells.animaltrance#animal_trance>`\  effect is entirely visual, so it doesn't have the sonic descriptor or work on blind creatures. As sightless sahuagin are blind, they are immune to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks. Isolated sightless sahuagin mutants arise near sites of ancient evil, and make even other sahuagin uneasy. Whole tribes of such mutants dwell in deep underwater trenches and caves, lost cities at the bottom of oceans, and cursed aquatic temples.

\ **Spined Sahuagin**\ : Covered in hundreds of needlelike spines, spined sahuagin can raise their piercing protrusions to impale creatures that touch them. Any creature that successfully grapples or is grappled by a spined sahuagin, or hits one with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training and :ref:`Improved Grapple <corerulebook.feats#improved_grapple>`\  as bonus feats. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive aquatic predators.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#sahuagin_feats`:

Sahuagin Feats
***************

The following feats are common among sahuagin.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#aquatic_advantage`:

Aquatic Advantage
==================

Foes without a swim speed provoke attacks of opportunity from you underwater.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Combat Reflexes <corerulebook.feats#combat_reflexes>`\ , must have a natural swim speed.

\ **Benefits**\ : A creature that lacks a swim speed provokes an attack of opportunity from you when it attacks you underwater. You don't get an attack of opportunity if the attacker is under the effects of :ref:`freedom of movement <corerulebook.spells.freedomofmovement#freedom_of_movement>`\  .

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#blood_tide`:

Blood Tide
===========

In the throes of blood frenzy, you can unleash a whirlwind of claws and teeth against your foes.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Combat Expertise <corerulebook.feats#combat_expertise>`\ , Greater Blood Frenzy \ \*, base attack bonus +6, blood frenzy ability, sahuagin.

\ **Benefits**\ : When you make a full attack while in a blood frenzy, you can give up your regular attacks to instead make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against each bleeding or wounded opponent within reach. You must use a natural weapon with these attacks, and you must make a separate attack roll against each opponent. You do not need to use the same natural weapon against each opponent.

When you use Blood Tide, you also forfeit any extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#greater_blood_frenzy`:

Greater Blood Frenzy
=====================

Your wounds move you into a deeper frenzy.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Blood frenzy ability, sahuagin.

\ **Benefits**\ : You no longer take a penalty to AC while in a blood frenzy. In addition, if you strike an enemy with both of your claw attacks—or two or more claw attacks if you have extra limbs—while in a blood frenzy, you can rend (as the special attack), dealing an amount of additional damage equal to your claw damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus (minimum 0).

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#sahuagin_spells`:

Sahuagin Spells
****************

Sahuagin choose spells that improve their natural gifts.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#air_breathing`:

Air Breathing
==============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  alchemist 3, bloodrager 3, cleric 3, druid 3, magus 3, shaman 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M/DF (flower or piece of grass)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  living aquatic creatures touched

\ **Duration**\  2 hours/level; see text

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures can breathe air freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell doesn't make creatures unable to breathe water.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#blood_in_the_water`:

Blood in the Water
===================

\ **School**\  necromancy (emotion); \ **Level**\  cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  20 ft.

\ **Area**\  20-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Will negates (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

As part of the casting of this spell, you must deal 1 point of piercing or slashing damage to yourself to release your blood. This causes you to take 1 point of bleed damage. While the spell is in effect, all sharks, feeders in the depths, and creatures with the blood frenzy ability in the area gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a –2 penalty to AC. This is treated as blood frenzy for the purposes of other feats and effects, and doesn't stack with the effects of actual blood frenzy. If you cease bleeding, the spell immediately ends.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#gift_of_the_deep`:

Gift of the Deep
=================

\ **School**\  transmutation (polymorph); \ **Level**\  cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\ **Target**\  one non-mutated sahuagin/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\ **Duration**\  1 minute/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude negate (harmless); \ **Spell Resistance**\  yes (harmless)

You give the targets the appearance and many of the abilities of sahuagin mutants, with effects as described below. Choose one benefit for all targets of this spell. This spell has no effect on sahuagin that are already mutants or already under the effects of \ *gift of the deep*\  .

\ *Four-Armed*\  : The sahuagin sprouts an extra pair of arms—which can be used to make claw attacks (dealing 1d4 points of damage), or to wield weapons or hold items. It gains the benefits of the :ref:`Multiattack <bestiary.monsterfeats#multiattack>`\  and :ref:`Multiweapon Fighting <bestiary.monsterfeats#multiweapon_fighting>`\  feats.

\ *Malenti*\  : The sahuagin's features shift to resemble those of an aquatic elf. It loses its light blindness as well as its claw and bite attacks. The sahuagin gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, and a +10 circumstance bonus on :ref:`Disguise <corerulebook.skills.disguise#disguise>`\  checks to appear to be an aquatic elf.

\ *Prehistoric*\  : The sahuagin grows in size, as :ref:`enlarge person <corerulebook.spells.enlargeperson#enlarge_person>`\  . It also gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor.

\ *Shark-Blooded*\  : The sahuagin's tail elongates and melds with its legs. Its mouth enlarges, increasing its bite damage by one size category (to 1d6 for a typical sahuagin). Its swim speed increases by 20 feet, but its land speed is reduced to 5 feet. The sahuagin can't be tripped.

\ *Sightless*\  : The sahuagin is blinded, but gains the benefits of the Blind Fight feat and blindsense with a range of 90 feet.

\ *Spined*\  : Spines grow on the sahuagin's scales. Any creature that successfully grapples with it, is grappled by it, or hits it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. The sahuagin also gains the benefits of the :ref:`Improved Grapple <corerulebook.feats#improved_grapple>`\  feat.

.. _`monstercodex.sahuagin#special_abilities`:

Special Abilities
==================

\ **Blood Feast (Su)**\  When a creature within 30 feet of a feeder in the depths takes bleed damage (including ongoing damage), the feeder heals an equal amount of damage.

\ **Deadly Bleeding (Su)**\  A feeder in the depth's bite causes bleeding wounds that resist healing. The first bite that damages a creature deals 1d4 points of bleed damage, and each subsequent bite increases the amount of bleed by 1d4. Stopping the bleeding requires a successful DC 20 :ref:`Heal <corerulebook.skills.heal#heal>`\  check or the application of any magical healing. However, anyone attempting to cast a healing spell on a creature suffering from deadly bleeding must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell doesn't affect the bleeding creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.

:ref:`Keen Scent <advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats#keen_scent>`\  (Ex) A feeder in the depths can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater, and can detect blood in the water at a distance of up to 1 mile.

\ **Swift Bite (Ex)**\  When making a full attack, a feeder in the depths can make a second bite attack at a –5 penalty.

Feeders in the depths closely resemble ordinary sharks, but they are faster, stronger, and far more intelligent and malevolent. Feeders in the depths begin life as ordinary sharks, raised under the care of sahuagin priestesses. A would-be feeder feasts on the flesh of merfolk, sea elves, and other aquatic humanoids. As it dines on these sacrifices, the priestess chants blasphemous rituals, infusing the shark with malign power and the stolen intelligence of its victims. Over the course of 13 feedings over 13 midwinters, a new feeder in the depths arises.

Feeders in the depths view themselves as equals to sahuagin, not as servants. They have no special affection for sharks, and can't communicate with them. Feeders act as loyal companions as long as they're respected and given the freedom to hunt. If not treated well, they rip their would-be masters apart and descend into the lightless depths of the ocean. Although able to breed, feeders in the depths give birth only to monstrosities or normal sharks, never to other feeders. A typical feeder in the depths is 24 feet long and weighs 5,500 pounds.
