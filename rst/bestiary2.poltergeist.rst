Special Abilities
==================

\ **Frightener (Su)**\  Once per minute as a standard action, a poltergeist can temporarily drop its :ref:`natural invisibility <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#natural_invisibility>`\ , revealing itself to be a skeletal, ghost-like :ref:`humanoid <bestiary.creaturetypes#humanoid>`\ . All creatures within 30 feet when a poltergeist uses this ability must make a DC 14 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 1d4 rounds. The poltergeist then resumes its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the :ref:`fear <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#fear_(su_or_sp)>`\  effect of that poltergeist for 24 hours. If the poltergeist's :ref:`natural invisibility <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#natural_invisibility>`\  is negated via other methods, it cannot use this ability. Likewise, those that can see invisible creatures are immune to this special attack. This is a mind-affecting :ref:`fear <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#fear_(su_or_sp)>`\  effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\ **Rejuvenation (Su)**\  When a poltergeist is destroyed, it only remains destroyed for 2d4 days. After this time, the :ref:`undead <bestiary.creaturetypes#undead>`\  spirit reforms where it was destroyed, fully healed. The only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a :ref:`good <bestiary.creaturetypes#good_subtype>`\  deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.

\ **Site Bound (Ex)**\  A poltergeist cannot travel more than 120 feet from the point at which it was created or formed.

\ **Telekinesis (Su)**\  A poltergeist has no method of attacking apart from telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell :ref:`telekinesis <corerulebook.spells.telekinesis#telekinesis>`\ , with a CL equal to the poltergeist's Hit Dice (CL 3rd for most poltergeists). A typical poltergeist has a ranged attack roll of +3 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 75 pounds. If a poltergeist attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 12 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A poltergeist is an angry spirit that forms from the soul of a creature that, for whatever reason, becomes unable to leave the site of its death. Sometimes, this might be due to an unfinished task—other times, it might be due to a powerful necromantic effect. Desecrating a grave site by building a structure over the body below is the most common method of accidentally creating a poltergeist. The poltergeist experiences great trauma over its condition; this trauma twists its psyche to evil and fosters an overall hatred of the living expressed in outbursts of rage. A poltergeist is bound to a specific place, usually a building, room, or recognizable area (a section of a cemetery, a stretch of lonely road, and so on). This place typically corresponds to its place of death or the resting place of its mortal remains.
