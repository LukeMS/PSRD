Mantle of Calm
===============

\ **School**\  enchantment (compulsion) [emotion, mind-affecting]; \ **Level**\  cleric 3, inquisitor 3, paladin 3, shaman 3

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  none and Will negates (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  no and yes (see text)

You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian's rage, bloodrager's bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage>`\  spell, skald's inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt a Will saving throw, without the rage effect's bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).

If you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your rage effect comes from a skald's raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot regain the effects of the song.
