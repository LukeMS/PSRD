Breath of Life
===============

\ **School**\ conjuration (healing); \ **Level**\ cleric 5

\ **Casting Time**\ 1 standard action

\ **Components**\ V, S

\ **Range**\ touch

\ **Target**\ creature touched

\ **Duration**\ instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates (harmless) or :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  half, see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless) or yes, see text

This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). 

Unlike other spells that heal damage, \ *breath of life*\  can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its :ref:`Constitution <corerulebook.gettingstarted#constitution>`\  score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its :ref:`Constitution <corerulebook.gettingstarted#constitution>`\  score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through \ *breath of life*\  gain a temporary :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ that lasts for 1 day.

Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by \ *breath of life*\ .

Like cure spells, \ *breath of life*\  deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.
