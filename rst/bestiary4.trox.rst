Special Abilities
==================

\ **Frenzy (Ex)**\ : Once per day when a trox takes damage, it flies into a frenzy for 1 minute, gaining a +2 racial bonus to Constitution and Strength, but a â2 penalty to AC.

\ **Grabbing Appendages (Ex)**\ : A trox's smaller arms are useful for little more than aiding grappling. Trox gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, and can maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main arms.

Trox were once members of a much smaller and more docile race of subterranean burrowers, but were long ago enslaved by the duergar and bred into useful brutes. Eventually, several clans of trox were able to escape their slavers and reach the surface world, though they found the creatures above were just as eager to enslave them. Most trox still live a life of servitude. A free trox tends to be loyal to its true friends and inquisitive, though it can harbor deep grudges and resentments.
