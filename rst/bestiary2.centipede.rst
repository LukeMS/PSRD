Special Abilities
==================

:ref:`Poison <bestiary.universalmonsterrules#poison_(ex_or_su)>`\  (Ex) Bite—injury; \ *save*\  Fort DC 17; \ *frequency*\  1/round for 6 rounds; \ *effect*\  1d4 Dex; \ *cure*\  1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Tail Slap (Ex)**\  A giant whiptail centipede's tail slap deals nonlethal damage and gains no bonus from its Strength score on damage dealt.

Whiptail centipedes are carrion eaters, though corpses large enough to satiate them are a rarity. Corpses of Huge or larger creatures left to rot often attract whiptail centipedes, who viciously defend their bounty against any who would intrude upon their lairs.
