Scaling Items
##############

Typically, player characters find themselves buying and selling magic items as they gain levels to keep up with the increasing threats they face. Items come and go from each character's inventory with such frequency that they hardly have the chance to impact the game's story. Scaling items, however, increase in power along with the characters who carry them, allowing an old and cherished item to develop and retain its utility rather than being sold and forgotten.

Scaling items work like normal magic items, but they gain new powers as their wielders gain levels, and their existing powers sometimes also improve. Additional item powers appear in a scaling magic item's entry with a header indicating the character level at which they unlock. 

The caster level of the item scales up as well. A scaling item's effective caster level is its listed caster level or the character level of its wielder, whichever is higher, to a maximum of the item's highest-level ability.  For instance, if an item has a base caster level of 5th and additional abilities at 7th and 9th levels, it's treated as caster level 8th in the hands of an 8th-level character, but is treated as only caster level 9th in the hands of a 10th-level character.

Each scaling item has a base price that represents its value to a character whose level is equal to or less than the item's caster level. As the item's caster level increases in the hands of a more powerful character, the item's value increases as well. The values of such items fall into three categories (baubles, prizes, and wonders), which indicate the rough percentage of the character's wealth a scaling item represents.

The weakest items, baubles, represent 5% of a PC's :ref:`character wealth at her level <corerulebook.gamemastering#table_12_4_character_wealth_by_level>`\  and can be compared to consumable magic items (even though baubles aren't destroyed by use). Items in the middle category, prizes, represent 15% of a PC's suggested wealth and correspond to magic items of moderate power. An item of the most valuable category, wonders, represents 30% of a PC's suggested wealth and corresponds to a major magic item, such as a fighter's most beloved and powerful sword. Wonders exceed the normal cost assumptions of the game at their highest level. Such items approach the power of minor artifacts, though they're not indestructible and can still be created normally.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#adjusting_treasure`:

Adjusting Treasure
*******************

Since scaling items improve as characters level up, they effectively add wealth to their owners over time. To balance this out, the Game Master should reduce treasure awards in proportion to how many scaling items the party has. This can be done per character or for the whole group, as described below. Note that the original level and price of a scaling item don't matter once the character's level exceeds the minimum caster level of the item, since the item accrues value based on its category (bauble, prize, or wonder), not on its original price. The adjustments to treasure awards are the same for all items in a category.

\ **Per Character**\ : If you apply the scaling item treasure reduction for each character, do so after dividing up shares of treasure for the characters. Reduce the treasure received by a character with a scaling item by the percentage listed for the item's category (5% for baubles, 15% for prizes, and 30% for wonders). If the character has multiple scaling items, combine the percentages before adjusting the amount of treasure.

For example, a PC with a wonder and a prize would receive 45% less treasure, because the PC has effectively already received that amount of treasure in the form of the items' increased values. Since the value of a scaling item is based on wealth for an entire level, apply this adjustment to every treasure allotment the character receives. If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items. This might be magical residue, vibrant crystals, or spellbook-style pages of magical phrases that increase the item's power. In any case, this substance should be treated as almost worthless to sell, and therefore useful only for upgrading scaling items.

\ **Group Basis**\ : You can use the scaling items of the whole party to adjust treasure. This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters. For example, if a group of four PCs have between them one bauble, three prizes, and a wonder, their treasure is reduced by 20% (80% divided by 4).

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#maximum_level`:

Maximum Level
**************

Many scaling items unlock new powers all the way up to 20th level. Others reach the caps on their abilities at lower levels. Once an item reaches the level of its most powerful ability, stop adjusting treasure for that item. At that point, the scaling item is considered fully "paid for."

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#mismatched_levels`:

Mismatched Levels
******************

If a PC receives a scaling item of a caster level lower than her character level, she effectively receives an item that's worth more than the price listed in the stat block. Reference :ref:`Table: Value of Scaling Items <unchained.magic.scalingitems#value_of_scaling_items>`\  and use the PC's level to estimate how much the item is really worth to that PC, and use that purchase price as its treasure value. Giving an item with a caster level higher than the character's level doesn't present the same problems; it just means the PC won't be unlocking the item's higher-level powers for some time. Don't reduce treasure for such an item until the PC's level exceeds the item's caster level.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#buying_and_selling`:

Buying and Selling
*******************

Selling a scaling item presents a tricky balance proposition. Such an item is worth more to a higher-level buyer, and a high-level seller has spent more effective wealth acquiring and keeping the item. The maximum amount a PC can get for a scaling item is half the value (as normal for selling magic items) listed on :ref:`Table: Value of Scaling Items <unchained.magic.scalingitems#value_of_scaling_items>`\  for the item's category and the PC's current level. To get this amount, the PC must find a motivated buyer of her level or higher, which may involve considerable time and effort. If the PC must sell in a hurry, she might get 25% of the listed value, or even less. A PC can't sell a scaling item for more than 50% of the item's value for her current level, even if she sells it to a higher-level NPC.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#crafting`:

Crafting
*********

Scaling items must be crafted at their highest level of power, with a cost determined by referencing :ref:`Table: Value of Scaling Items <unchained.magic.scalingitems#value_of_scaling_items>`\ . Start with the value listed on the table for the item's category and its highest-level ability. Divide this by 2 to get the crafting cost, and add the value of any nonmagical armor or weapon component. The crafting cost is always much higher than the market price of a scaling item, since the crafting cost is based on the full set of abilities but the market price is based on the minimum caster level. When a PC crafts a scaling item, he doesn't need to pay any further cost in reduced treasure for keeping the item, because the full value of the item has already been accounted for. When setting the DC for crafting a scaling item, use the item's highest-level ability instead of its base caster level.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#pricing_new_scaling_items`:

Pricing New Scaling Items
**************************

To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.

\ **Pricing the Base Item**\ : First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the normal rules for :ref:`creating magic items <corerulebook.magicitems.magicitemcreation>`\ . Then, using the column on :ref:`Table: Value of Scaling Items <unchained.magic.scalingitems#value_of_scaling_items>`\  that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level. 

\ **Adding Scaling Abilities**\ :Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.

\ *Adding Unlockable Abilities*\ : Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a :ref:`burning hands <corerulebook.spells.burninghands#burning_hands>`\  effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements :ref:`burning hands <corerulebook.spells.burninghands#burning_hands>`\  so well.

\ *Adding Spells*\ : Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. :ref:`Table: Spell Prices <unchained.magic.scalingitems#spell_prices>`\  includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\ ), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for :ref:`fireball <corerulebook.spells.fireball#fireball>`\ . Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level. 

Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.

\ *Assigning an Unlock Level*\ : Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).

\ **Completing the Item**\ : Repeat this process for each set of new powers. Try to add a new unlockable ability every 2 to 4 levels. It's not necessary to scale every item all the way to 20th level, however—stop when the set of abilities feels complete.

Standalone Scaling Items
*************************

A GM can include specific scaling items as individual pieces of treasure even if she isn't using the scaling items system in her game. The base item can be used without any of the higher-level upgrades, or the GM can pick a higher level and create an individual item that has the base abilities plus one or more unlocked levels. She should use the standard price for that level of scaling item, as described on :ref:`Table: Value of Scaling Items <unchained.magic.scalingitems#value_of_scaling_items>`\ .

For example, a GM could give out a :ref:`spear of the huntmaster <unchained.magic.scalingitems#spear_of_the_huntsmaster>`\  as a CL 6th item worth 3,202 gp with just the base abilities, a CL 8th item worth 4,950 gp with the base abilities plus the 8th-level unlockable ability, a CL 10th item worth 9,300 gp with the base abilities plus the 8th- and 10th-level unlockable abilities, and so on.

Scaling Items
**************

The following scaling items include several examples of wonders, prizes, and baubles.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#specific_armor_and_shields`:

Specific Armor and Shields
===========================

The following section includes armor and shields with unusual powers and magical abilities. Magic armor can have abilities that need to be activated to function or powers that work passively and constantly.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#armageddon_plate`:

Armageddon Plate
=================

\ **Price**\  2,650 gp; \ **Slot**\  armor; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  50 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation; \ **Scaling**\  wonder

A suit of \ *armageddon plate*\  acts as \ *+1 full plate*\  for nearly any wearer—it automatically resizes when donned to fit wearers of size Small to Large. The armor is blackened, with joints and helm in a style reminiscent of the legendary tarrasque.

\ **6th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  is \ *+1 light fortification full plate*\ .

\ **8th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  retaliates against melee attackers when its fortification ability triggers. When an attacker strikes the wearer with a melee weapon and the armor negates a critical hit or sneak attack, the power of the armor leaves the attacker shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and can stack with itself to make an attacker frightened or panicked. 

\ **11th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  is \ *+1 moderate fortification full plate.*

\ **13th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  is\ *+2 moderate fortification full plate*\ . The save DC of its fear effect increases to 20, and it affects attackers who use both ranged and melee weapons.

\ **16th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  is \ *+2 moderate fortification full plate of invulnerability*\ . \ *Armageddon plate*\  grants DR 5/— instead of DR 5/magic. 

\ **18th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  is\ *+2 moderate fortification adamantine full plate of determination*\ UE\ *and invulnerability*\ . The damage reduction from adamantine stacks with the modified \ *invulnerability*\  effect for a total of DR 8/—.

\ **20th Level**\ : \ *Armageddon plate*\  is\ *+2 heavy fortification adamantine full plate of determination*\ UE\ *and invulnerability*\ . Once per day, the wearer can lengthen the spines of the armor and release a volley of six spines as a full-attack action, all at the wearer's highest base attack bonus with a range increment of 120 feet. Each spine that hits deals 2d10 damage + the wearer's Strength bonus. If the spines attack multiple targets, all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Once per day, the wearer can change her base land speed to 150 feet for 1 round as a free action. If she chooses to do so, she does not apply any other modifications that increase her movement speed for that round.

\ **Price**\  305 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  4th; \ **Weight**\  1/10 lb.; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation; \ **Scaling**\  bauble

This ornately carved arrow always survives being fired. By concentrating as a standard action, the last person to shoot the arrow can sense the direction in which it lies, up to a distance of 1 mile. This effect fades 24 hours after firing. Initially, a legacy arrow acts merely as a masterwork arrow, but it always retains its ability to survive and be recovered after use. Legacy arrows can be found as other sorts of ammunition, including bolts, shuriken, sling bullets, and even firearm bullets.

\ **6th Level**\ : The arrow has the \ *distance*\  special ability, normally not available to ammunition. When fired, it loses this weapon special ability and any gained at higher levels for 1 day.

\ **9th Level**\ : The arrow has the \ *distance*\  and \ *seeking*\  special abilities.

\ **11th Level**\ : When fired, the arrow regains its special abilities after 10 minutes instead of 1 day.

\ **14th Level**\ : Once per day as a standard action, the arrow's wielder can designate it as a \ *bane*\  arrow for a category of her choice. It retains its current \ *bane*\  properties until they are changed. The arrow still takes 10 minutes to regain the use of \ *bane*\ , as usual.

\ **16th Level**\ : The arrow retains its \ *bane*\ , \ *distance*\ , and \ *seeking*\  special abilities after being fired.

\ **18th Level**\ : Once per week, the wielder can take a standard action to fire the arrow, giving it the properties of a \ *greater slaying*\  arrow (keyed to the same category as its \ *bane*\  ability) in addition to its other special abilities. After being fired, the arrow loses all special abilities for 1 week.

\ **20th Level**\ : The \ *greater slaying*\  ability can be used once per day (after which the arrow loses all special abilities for 1 day) rather than once per week. The arrow overcomes damage reduction as though adamantine.

Rods
=====

Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and usually do not have any charges. Anyone can use a rod.

.. _`unchained.magic.scalingitems#mimetic_rod`:

Mimetic Rod
============

\ **Price**\  1,350 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  7th; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate divination; \ **Scaling**\  bauble

The smooth surface of this rod is polished to a mirror sheen. Two cabochons—one amber and one viridian—set into the ends of the rod control its functions. A creature can press the viridian stone and roll the rod across a piece of writing on a flat surface to copy that writing into the rod, leaving the original text intact. By pressing the amber cabochon and rolling the rod across a different flat surface, a creature can replicate the original text. The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a \ *mimetic rod*\ , but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook. The rod can't copy traps that use magical writing, such as :ref:`explosive runes <corerulebook.spells.explosiverunes#explosive_runes>`\ , but attempting to do so doesn't trigger the trap unless the movement of the magic item over the text would normally trigger it.

\ **9th Level**\ : The rod can be used to copy faces. It must first be waved in front of either a person's actual face or a high-quality reproduction while the wielder presses the viridian cabochon. The stored face can then be replicated over someone else's face as though they'd been affected by :ref:`disguise self <corerulebook.spells.disguiseself#disguise_self>`\  (though this can change only the face—not height, weight, or other features). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level possessed by the person activating the rod (to a maximum of 140 minutes). The rod can store only one face at a time, and can't store a face while it's storing text.

\ **11th Level**\ : If the rod's user speaks the name of a language, the rod automatically translates any text stored in it to that language. When that text is reproduced, it comes out in the language it has been translated to. A piece of text can be translated any number of times while stored in the rod.

\ **14th Level**\ : The rod can copy and reproduce magical traps that rely on text, including \ *symbols*\ . The rod's user must succeed at a caster level check (caster level 14th) with a DC equal to 11 + the targeted spell's caster level to do so. If she succeeds, the trap is stored harmlessly in the rod and can be replicated just as text would. Unlike with normal text, the spell is erased from inside the rod when it's replicated. The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged. The rod's wielder can also press the viridian cabochon to harmlessly extinguish the spell instead of reproducing it.

\ **Price**\  16,005 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  9th; \ **Weight**\  4 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate necromancy; \ **Scaling**\  wonder

This baton and the small skull that tops it are both made of blackened adamantine. The rod can be wielded as a \ *+1 conductive*\ \ *light mace*\ . At the wielder's command, it transforms into a morningstar, heavy mace, flail, or heavy flail. It returns to its normal shape if left unattended for 1 round. Commanders of undead legions often wield such rods as symbols of authority. Changing the weapon's type can be used to signal a change in strategy for the undead horde, with the mace indicating a steady march, the morningstar calling for an aggressive assault, a flail indicating a retreat, and so on. 

\ **11th Level**\ : The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +2.

\ **13th Level**\ : Any creature hit by the \ *rod of the deadlord*\ gains a temporary negative level. The target avoids this negative level if it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 6 + the wielder's Hit Dice (maximum 21). This negative level lasts for 12 hours, and can't become a permanent negative level.

\ **15th Level**\ : If the wielder confirms a critical hit, instead of gaining a temporary negative level the target gains a permanent negative level with no saving throw. Each day thereafter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (using the same DC as the 13th-level unlockable ability) or acquire another negative level. This is a curse effect that continues until removed (DC 23) or until the target dies. A target slain by this curse cannot be revived from death until the curse is removed.

\ **17th Level**\ : The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +3. Once per day, the rod's owner can tap the rod on the ground as a standard action to duplicate the effects of :ref:`animate dead <corerulebook.spells.animatedead#animate_dead>`\ . The total HD of undead the owner can control in this way is equal to her level. If she controls other undead from castings of :ref:`animate dead <corerulebook.spells.animatedead#animate_dead>`\ , she uses only the highest maximum she can control—the values do not stack. She ceases to control undead created by the rod if the rod leaves her possession.

Staves

A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Staves usually hold spells grouped by a theme and sometimes possess other abilities that they grant to the wielder. A staff has 10 charges when created but can be recharged by a spellcaster with the appropriate spells.

This wooden staff is carved with intricate patterns of waves, wind, trails, and vines. As the wielder goes up in level, the patterns begin to move, slowly at first, but gradually increasing in speed and magnitude. At the highest levels, the staff appears to be filled with a twisting and complex nature scene, with forking paths and raging tsunamis. This staff allows the use of the following spells.

â¢:ref:`longstrider <corerulebook.spells.longstrider#longstrider>`\  (1 charge)

\ **20th Level**\ : The staff grants its owner a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability). \ *Find the path*\ now costs 2 charges, and \ *freedom of movement*\ costs only 1 charge. If the staff's wielder breaks the staff in two as a full-round action, she can transport herself and up to 19 allies to a safe location she knows extremely well. This ability ignores local conditions as if it were the transport travelers effect of a \ *wish*\ .

Wondrous Items
===============

Wondrous items are diverse. Some must be worn in a specific magic item slot in order to work, while others must merely be possessed and used. "Wondrous item" is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into other groups, such as weapons, staves, and so on. Anyone can use a wondrous item, unless the item specifies otherwise.

There are two main categories of wondrous items: slotted and slotless. Slotted items take up a magic item slot, and must be worn by those who want to benefit from them.

\ **Price**\  900 gp; \ **Slot**\  shoulders; \ **CL**\  4th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation; \ **Scaling**\  prize

This red-and-violet silk garment, delicately embroidered with a barely perceptible weblike pattern, grants its wearer a +2 luck bonus on saving throws against spider poison.

\ **14th Level**\ : Normal spiders, including spider swarms and unusually large spiders, will not attack the cloak's wearer unless she attacks them first or they are instructed to do so by some other creature, such as through a use of vermin empathy or a spell. The cloak's wearer can summon forth a swarm of spiders once per day as the spell :ref:`summon swarm <corerulebook.spells.summonswarm#summon_swarm>`\ .

\ **16th Level**\ : The cloak's wearer can attempt to influence spiders, as the mite's vermin empathy ability. The wearer does not gain a racial bonus to vermin empathy. She can change into the form of a Small or Medium spider and back at will as a standard action, as :ref:`vermin shape I <ultimatemagic.spells.verminshape#vermin_shape_i>`\ .

\ **17th Level**\ : The cloak's wearer can summon a swarm of spiders at will, instead of once per day.

\ **10th Level**\ : The wearer can grasp the edges of the cloak to fly(as the \ *fly*\ spell) for up to 7 minutes three times per day, but only in dim light or lower. After each use of this ability, the wearer must wait for at least as long as the \ *fly*\ effect lasted until using this ability again.  

\ **12th Level**\ : For each daily use of \ *fly*\ , the wearer can instead choose to transform into an ordinary bat as \ *beast shape III*\ for the same duration.

\ **14th Level**\ : The wearer can use \ *fly*\ or :ref:`beast shape III <corerulebook.spells.beastshape#beast_shape_iii>`\  any number of times per day, but is still subject to the dim light restriction and the limit on using the ability again after a previous use.

\ **18th Level**\ : The wearer constantly gains the echolocation of a bat. He can hear high-pitched sounds such as bat echolocation, and he gains blindsense 20 feet. This blindsense is sound-based, and is blocked by spells such as \ *silence*\ .

Instead of using \ *beast shape*\ or \ *fly*\ , he can transform himself into a bat swarm, gaining the abilities of a bat as :ref:`beast shape III <corerulebook.spells.beastshape#beast_shape_iii>`\  plus the bat swarm's distraction, immunity to weapon damage, swarm traits, and wounding abilities.

\ **Price**\  3,600 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  7th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  moderate conjuration; \ **Scaling**\  prize

This flared and stoppered flask of tempered glass can store up to 5 doses of poison, all of which can be different types. The owner can craft up to 5 doses of poison simultaneously using the beaker. She must still attempt separate :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) checks for each dose of poison to ensure successful crafting, but she can make progress on all five poisons simultaneously (making checks for the week's or day's progress at the same time).

The user can also add already-completed doses of poison to the beaker. All poisons remain separate and unmixed as long as they remain within the beaker, and the user can decant any of the poisons (including incomplete poisons) by naming the poison she wishes to pour forth.

\ **9th Level**\ : When crafting a poison within the beaker, the crafter uses the poison's gp value instead of its sp value when determining her progress.

\ **11th Level**\ : Once per day, the owner of a \ *beaker of plentiful poisons*\ can produce 1 additional dose of any completed poison stored in the flask. The additional dose loses its efficacy 1 minute after being decanted. The market price of the duplicated poison can't exceed an amount equal to 20 gp × the beaker's caster level; any unused value is lost. A creature must have had the \ *beaker of plentiful poisons*\ in its possession for at least 24 hours to create poisons in this way.

If the wearer also wears the :ref:`cloak of the elven spirit <unchained.magic.scalingitems#cloak_of_the_elven_spirit>`\ , the boots grant her the ability to use \ *tree stride*\ as the spell, entering up to 20 trees each day.

These coarse, heavy boots are fitted with numerous iron plates and rusted spikes that give them an intimidating appearance. The wearer can use \ *brutish boots*\ to attack as if using a masterwork cold iron gauntlet or masterwork cold iron spiked gauntlet, depending on which portion of the boot he uses. 

These boots also protect the wearer's feet as if they had hardness 8. This hardness applies only against effects that directly affect the target's feet, such as caltrops, \ *spike growth, spike stones,*\ or stepping into a puddle of acid. It also applies against effects that deal damage to an attacker, such as :ref:`fire shield <corerulebook.spells.fireshield#fire_shield>`\ ,\ *thorn body*\ , or the barbed defense of a barbed devil, but only if the wearer is using the \ *brutish boots*\  to make the attack.

This elaborate tiara looks as though it's made of intricately carved ice adorned with small, crystalline gemstones. Despite the item's fragile appearance, it has hardness 12 and 10 hit points. Its wearer gains the constant effects of :ref:`endure elements <corerulebook.spells.endureelements#endure_elements>`\  against cold conditions only.

\ **5th Level**\ : Once per day, the wearer can summon a Small ice elemental as :ref:`summon monster II <corerulebook.spells.summonmonster#summon_monster_ii>`\ .

\ **7th Level**\ : As a standard action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged attack. On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, the wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.

\ **10th Level**\ : As part of her move action, the wearer can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new steps in whichever direction she travels. These steps melt away behind her. If others try to climb the steps, they crumble away, leaving only the portions beneath the wearer's feet intact. This otherwise acts as the \ *air walk*\ spell. She can use this ability each day for 10 minutes per level, divided any way she chooses in 10-minute intervals.

\ **12th Level**\ : Once per day, the wearer can call forth an :ref:`ice storm <corerulebook.spells.icestorm#ice_storm>`\ .

\ **16th Level**\ : The wearer can use the tiara to call up a tower of ice, as an \ *instant fortress*\  (except that the tiara does not transform into the tower, the tower takes 1 minute to rise instead of 1 round, the walls of the tower have only hardness 12, and damage to the tower does not carry over between multiple uses of this ability). 

\ **18th Level**\ : When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she can choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base with 20-foot-high rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high. At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that can move at incredible speed. Treat this as \ *wind walk*\ except she gains vulnerability to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However, she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so, she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can choose to summon 1d4+1 Medium ice elementals, 1d3 Large ice elementals, or one Huge ice elemental as :ref:`summon monster VI <corerulebook.spells.summonmonster#summon_monster_vi>`\ .

\ **20th Level**\ : The wearer gains cold resistance 30.

She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs to fall.

Once per day, the wearer can gain the benefit of \ *darkvision*\ , as the spell. A typical \ *dragon robe*\  is attuned to red dragons, though variants attuned to other types of dragons exist.

\ **14th Level**\ : The wearer can use :ref:`dragon's breath <advancedplayersguide.spells.dragonsbreath#dragons_breath>`\  (red dragon) once per day. The save DC is equal to 13 + the wearer's Constitution modifier, and spell resistance does not apply.

This small, colorful feather waves gently as if blown by a constant breeze. As a standard action, the feather's owner can change its form into another variety of feather token. Any owner can use an \ *eternal feather token*\  to duplicate the effects of an \ *anchor feather token*\ . Higher-level owners have additional options. The token remains transformed until its owner commands it to change again, or until it is activated in that form like a normal \ *feather token*\ . Once activated, the token reverts to the appearance of a normal feather of a dingy gray color. Over the next week, it slowly regains its color. A week after its last activation, it can be used again.

\ **7th Level**\ : The feather can become a \ *fan feather token*\ .

\ **Price**\  5,000 gp; \ **Slot**\  body; \ **CL**\  8th; \ **Weight**\  6 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate necromancy; \ **Scaling**\  prize

These ragged robes are threadbare and frayed, caked with dirt and grime. Through constant exposure to innocuous forms of disease, the wearer becomes inured to sickness and filth, gaining a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws versus disease and effects that cause the nauseated or sickened condition. \ *Filthy rags*\ can be worn in conjunction with armor. 

\ **10th Level**\ : The rags begin to crawl with insects and spiders, granting the wearer familiarity with the feeling of tiny creatures crawling over her body. After wearing the rags for 24 consecutive hours, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the distraction ability of swarms. Once per day, she can make the spiders in her rags swarm out and attack her foes, causing the rags to expel spiders as the spell :ref:`vomit swarm <advancedplayersguide.spells.vomitswarm#vomit_swarm>`\ .

\ **11th Level**\ : Wasps build a small hive somewhere in the rags' interior. When the wearer uses :ref:`vomit swarm <advancedplayersguide.spells.vomitswarm#vomit_swarm>`\ , she can choose between spiders and wasps.

\ **13th Level**\ : The rags' diseases become more communicable. Any living creature striking the wearer with a bite attack contracts filth fever. A successful DC 14 Fortitude negates the disease. Oozes and vermin are immune to this effect, as are creatures such as otyughs and rats that are at home in exceptional filth. 

\ **16th Level**\ : Army ants build a colony within the rags, and the rags' filth becomes utterly vile. The wearer can also choose army ants when using :ref:`vomit swarm <advancedplayersguide.spells.vomitswarm#vomit_swarm>`\ . Any biting creature that fails its saving throw against the rags' filth fever becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and even on a successful save, the creature is still sickened for 1 round.

\ **Price**\  2,650 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  4th; \ **Weight**\  —; \ **Aura**\  faint conjuration and divination; \ **Scaling**\  bauble

This thin silver flask can hold a single ounce of liquid. If a potion of a 1st-level spell is poured into the flask, the flask's interior analyzes and bonds to that potion. Once the potion is drunk, the flask begins to hiss and bubble, as strange liquids and reagents slowly mix within it. After 1 full week, the flask has produced a new potion of the same 1st-level spell at minimum caster level. If anyone drinks or empties the flask before the week is over, they gain no benefit, the nascent potion is lost, and the flask ceases concocting until it is filled with a new 1st-level potion. If a potion in the flask is poured out of the flask, rather than drunk directly from it, the flask does not reconcoct that potion.

\ **6th Level**\ : The flask takes only 1 day to reconcoct a 1st-level potion, rather than 1 week.

\ **8th Level**\ : The flask can reconcoct a potion of a 2nd-level spell, but it takes 1 week.

==============

\ **Price**\  5,950 gp; \ **Slot**\  wrists; \ **CL**\  8th; \ **Weight**\  2 lbs.; \ **Aura**\  moderate evocation; \ **Scaling**\  prize

These crystal-accented bracers are bound with metallic straps and a fine lacework of embedded wire. The wearer can cause the bracers to create a shield of force to protect him. Each bracer can create a shield for up to 10 total minutes per day. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments. If only one \ *force bracer*\  is used, it creates a buckler, light shield, or heavy shield of force. If the wearer activates both \ *force bracers*\ , the shield of force is the equivalent of a tower shield.

Regardless of which type of force shield is created, the shield is weightless and has only half the normal armor check penalty, but otherwise follows all of the normal rules for shield use and proficiency. The shield grants the corresponding shield bonus to AC. Because the shield is made of force, its bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.

\ **10th Level**\ : If the wearer has created a heavy shield of force, the wearer can expend 1 minute of the shield's duration to make a single shield bash attack as if the shield had the \ *bashing*\  shield special ability, with an enhancement bonus on the attack roll equal to 1/4 the wearer's Hit Dice (maximum +5).

\ **12th Level**\ : If the wearer has created a tower shield of force, the wearer can release the tower shield from his person and use it as a \ *forceful hand*\ with hit points equal to 1/2 the wearer's hit points. The wearer gains none of the benefits of using a tower shield while the \ *forceful hand*\ exists. Each round of using the \ *forceful hand*\ consumes 1 minute of duration from each bracer.

\ **8th Level**\ : The wearer can use \ *spark*\ at will.

\ **10th Level**\ : The wearer gains fire resistance 5, and her hands are immune to fire damage, so she can pick up hot objects or touch flames without being harmed. Weapons affected by \ *heat metal*\ or similar effects deal no damage to the wearer, and the wearer likewise ignores damage from effects like \ *fire shield*\ (hot flames version) that deal fire damage to a creature attacking in melee.

\ **11th Level**\ : The \ *forgemaster's gauntlets*\  are \ *+1 gauntlets*\ .

\ **12th Level**\ : The wearer of the \ *forgemaster's gauntlets*\ can heat objects she touches. She can use \ *heat metal*\ (DC 13) at will. If she's targeting a metal object worn by a foe, she must succeed at a melee touch attack. If the targeted item is being held or wielded, the wearer of the \ *forgemaster's gauntlets*\ must attempt a combat maneuver check as if she were attempting to sunder the item. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the wearer does not have the Improved Sunder feat.

==============

\ **Price**\  710 gp; \ **Slot**\  belt; \ **CL**\  5th; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  faint conjuration; \ **Scaling**\  bauble

This colorful sash seems to be the sort normally worn by any common sailor or traveler, yet within its folds is a bountiful pocket. The wearer can reach into this hidden pocket and remove a piece of fruit a number of times per day equal to his character level. The type of fruit varies. One piece of fruit has enough nourishment and water to sustain one humanoid for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the fruit rots and cannot nourish anyone. 

Once removed from its wearer, the sash doesn't produce fruit for anyone else for 24 hours. If redonned by its most recent wearer during that time, the sash resumes function normally (and the amount of fruit remaining within it isn't reset).

\ **6th Level**\ : Consuming a fruit produced from the sash cures a creature of 1 point of damage as if it were a :ref:`goodberry <corerulebook.spells.goodberry#goodberry>`\ . A given creature can recover a maximum of 8 hit points in this way in a 24-hour period.

\ **8th Level**\ : Three times per day, the wearer can draw forth a large, ripe piece of healing fruit that explodes when thrown. This functions as a splash weapon, but cures a target it hits of 1d6 points of damage and cures each creature it splashes on of 1 point of damage. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.

\ **10th Level**\ : Once per day, the wearer can draw forth one piece of fruit that acts as a \ *potion of cure moderate wounds*\ , :ref:`delay poison <corerulebook.spells.delaypoison#delay_poison>`\ , :ref:`lesser restoration <corerulebook.spells.restoration#lesser_restoration>`\ , or :ref:`remove paralysis <corerulebook.spells.removeparalysis#remove_paralysis>`\ . This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.

\ **13th Level**\ : The fruits produced by the sash cure 1d4 points of damage each instead of 1 point. An exploding fruit's healing power is unchanged.

\ **15th Level**\ : Once per week, the sash can produce the effects of \ *heroes' feast*\ .

These gloves are woven of a fine copper mesh and wire, and infuse the wearer's hands with an electric charge. The wearer can use the \ *galvanic gauntlets*\ to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage. She gains a +3 bonus on the attack if the target is wearing metal armor or is composed of metal.

\ **7th Level**\ : The touch attack's damage increases to 2d6 points of electricity damage.

\ **9th Level**\ : If the wearer uses her hands to make unarmed strikes (including when making a combat maneuver check to damage an opponent in a grapple), those attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage on each hit, as if she were using a weapon with the \ *shock*\  weapon special ability.

\ **11th Level**\ : Any item held in the wearer's hands gains a powerful static charge, and any creature attempting to disarm the wearer of an object she is holding (or to make a steal combat maneuver against the gloves themselves) takes 1d6 points of electrical damage and must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the shock. This static charge does not harm items the wearer is holding.

\ **13th Level**\ : The \ *shock*\  ability of the gauntlets improves to the \ *shocking burst*\  weapon special ability.

\ **15th Level**\ : Once per day when the wearer hits a creature with the gauntlets' touch attack, she can create electric arcs that strike nearby creatures. This functions as though the target of the attack had been the primary target of a :ref:`chain lightning <corerulebook.spells.chainlightning#chain_lightning>`\  spell (Reflex DC 19 half), though the hit creature doesn't take any additional damage.

As a full-round action, she can attempt a DC 20 :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (oratory) check to affect all allies who can hear her with \ *good hope*\ for 1 round. If she fails the check, all allies who heard her ineloquent speech cannot benefit from this ability for 24 hours. 

 \ **12th Level**\ : The wearer can improve someone's attitude up to three steps when using :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ . When she uses :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  to influence someone, she can present herself as glorious and powerful without threatening them, causing the attempt to operate like a :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  check to influence instead.

 \ **14th Level**\ : When the wearer uses the gorget's \ *good hope*\ ability, it lasts 1 additional round for every 10 by which her result exceeds the :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (oratory) check DC.

The wearer of these cloud-blue, cool-to-the-touch gloves can sculpt and shape creations of cloud and mist­— both her own and those of others. The wearer can call upon the power of the gloves up to three times per day when creating a cloud of gas or mist with a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or magical item in order to make the area of effect shapeable (\ *Core Rulebook*\ 215). 

Alternatively, the wearer can use the gloves to disperse an existing cloud of gas or mist by touch, as if using :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ . If the effect is nonmagical, it is automatically dispersed in a 20-foot-radius spread centered on the wearer.

\ **10th Level**\ : The wearer can use :ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\  twice per day.

\ **12th Level**\ : The wearer can disrupt a creature under the effects of :ref:`gaseous form <corerulebook.spells.gaseousform#gaseous_form>`\ . To do so, she must succeed at a melee touch attack against the gaseous target. If the attack hits, the wearer can choose to either lock the gaseous creature in place as if using \ *hold monster*\  or disperse the target, dealing 5d6 points of damage and nauseating the target for 5 rounds. In either case, the target is also locked into its gaseous form and can't resume solid form until the effect expires. A successful DC 17 Will saving throw negates this effect.

This carved darkwood amulet resembles a human heart. As a move action while standing on earth, stone, or wood, its wearer can sprout woody, rootlike tendrils from his legs that anchor his feet to the ground. While so anchored, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMD against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, trip, and other combat maneuvers that would force him from his space, as well as on saving throws against effects that would force him from his space on a failed save. The roots fall away if the wearer moves from his space, even involuntarily. 

\ **11th Level**\ : When anchored to the ground, the wearer's roots interfere with adjacent foes. Foes adjacent to the wearer must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save each round or be entangled by the roots as if by the spell \ *entangle*\ . If the wearer's roots fall away due to movement, all entangled enemies are immediately released. 

\ **13th Level**\ : When struck by a nonliving wooden or wooden-hafted weapon of Huge size or smaller, the wearer can lash back and affect that weapon with :ref:`warp wood <corerulebook.spells.warpwood#warp_wood>`\  as an immediate action (Will DC 20 negates). This ability is usable three times per day.

\ **15th Level**\ : The wearer can make a secondary natural attack with his roots, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + 1/2 the user's Strength bonus. At the beginning of the wearer's turn, if he still possesses roots from a previous round, the secondary root attack gains 5 feet of reach. This increase stacks with itself to a maximum of triple the wearer's natural reach, but it doesn't stack with any other increases. The reach resets whenever the roots fall away.

\ **17th Level**\ : The wearer gains the pull (root, 10 feet) universal monster ability.

\ **20th Level**\ : As long as the wearer's roots are planted in the ground, he gains the effect of a \ *ring of regeneration*\ . When the roots fall away, it counts as removing the ring, so he only regenerates damage taken after planting the roots and before moving. As long as the wearer activates his roots for at least 8 hours each day, he does not need to sleep.

This small pendant of brass and glass is crafted in the shape of a lantern and continuously sheds light as a \ *light*\ spell. As a move action, the wearer can open the miniature \ *lantern pendant*\ and direct the tiny phantasmal fire within to float to any point within 110 feet. This functions as :ref:`dancing lights <corerulebook.spells.dancinglights#dancing_lights>`\ , but the wearer can create a number of lights equal to 1/2 his character level, up to a maximum of four, and can create only torchlike lights, not glowing spheres or humanoid shapes. While the \ *dancing lights*\ are active, the light of the \ *lantern pendant*\ itself is extinguished.

\ **6th Level**\ : Once per day, the wearer can command the phantasmal fire to fly forth and limn all creatures in an area as :ref:`faerie fire <corerulebook.spells.faeriefire#faerie_fire>`\ . Just as when using :ref:`dancing lights <corerulebook.spells.dancinglights#dancing_lights>`\ , the pendant's light is extinguished throughout the duration.

The \ *daylight*\ is suppressed whenever he activates any other ability that extinguishes the pendant's light, but such time still counts against its duration.

When the wearer successfully demoralizes a creature with an :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  check, the penalties for being shaken increase by 2 on checks and rolls involving the wearer. For example, attacks made against the wearer and saves against her spells would take a –4 penalty rather than a –2 penalty.

This mask of malleable mithral can be attached to any helmet and worn in conjunction with it. The mask can be placed over the face of a helpless humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature, living or dead, and activated with a command word. The mask absorbs the creature's thoughts and memories and reshapes itself into the creature's likeness—a process that takes 10 minutes.

\ **10th Level**\ : The creature speaking the command can substitute \ *nightmare*\ for :ref:`modify memory <corerulebook.spells.modifymemory#modify_memory>`\ ,with the same DC. Additionally, the mask's wearer can understand and read (but not speak) all languages the target creature knows.

\ **12th Level**\ : The mask's wearer can also speak the languages the target creature knows. Additionally, she can attempt to pry the answers to specific questions from the absorbed memories once per day. Treat this as \ *speak with dead*\ if the target creature was dead, and otherwise as \ *contact other plane*\ to contact a creature from the Astral Plane with no chance of ability score decrease.

\ **14th Level**\ : If the target creature is a humanoid, the wearer can take its form as \ *alter self*\ instead of :ref:`disguise self <corerulebook.spells.disguiseself#disguise_self>`\ .

====================

\ **Price**\  15 gp; \ **Slot**\  none; \ **CL**\  1st; \ **Weight**\  1 lb.; \ **Aura**\  faint transmutation; \ **Scaling**\  bauble

This delicate pouch contains sparkling dust of various iridescent colors. The owner can withdraw the dust and use it as an unlimited supply of normal colorful powder. She always withdraws powder of the color she desires.

\ **4th Level**\ : Once per day, the owner can imbue the pixie dust she draws from the pouch with fey power to reveal the unseen. This functions as \ *faerie fire*\ with a 1-minute duration, but she must throw the powder as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet against an AC of 5 to hit the correct grid intersection. On a miss, treat the dust as a splash weapon to determine the center of the effect.

\ **6th Level**\ \ *:*\ The owner can use the \ *faerie fire*\ ability three times per day.

\ **8th Level**\ : The owner can use the \ *faerie fire*\ ability at will.

\ **10th Level**\ : The owner can increase the power of the pixie dust once per day, producing a \ *glitterdust*\ effect (Will DC 13 negates the blindness) for 3 rounds. She must throw the powder as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet against an AC of 5 to hit the correct grid intersection. On a miss, treat the dust as a splash weapon to determine the center of the effect.

\ **13th Level**\ : The owner can use the \ *glitterdust*\ ability three times per day.

To hit a willing non-adjacent target with the pixie dust, she must throw the dust as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet and hit an AC of 5 + any modifiers that add to both the target's flat-footed and touch AC, such as deflection bonuses and cover bonuses. On a miss, treat the dust as a splash weapon; if there are creatures in the resulting square, randomly determine which creature in that square is targeted by the \ *fly*\  effect.

When donned, this sheer, sleeved robe fades to near invisibility. It grants the wearer a +4 competence bonus on :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ , :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\ , and :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks against fey. On command, the mantle glows in delicate \ *faerie fire*\ of any color of the wearer's choice, and a second command word ends the glow.

\ **8th Level**\ : The mantle magnifies and sharpens the wearer's beauty such that her +4 competence bonus now applies on all Charisma checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks against any creature. Against fey, the bonus increases to +6.

\ **10th Level**\ : The mantle's wearer becomes manipulative and eloquent in social situations. Whenever she converses with creatures, she can insert a \ *suggestion*\ (Will DC 14 negates) for every 10 minutes of conversation by succeeding at a DC 14 :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (oratory) check. If she ever fails the :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  (oratory) check to use this ability, all creatures who witnessed her misstep are immune to this ability for 24 hours.

\ **12th Level**\ : Once per day, the wearer can release the glow within the mantle in a single coruscating burst of color. This blinds creatures in a 10-foot radius (Reflex DC 19 negates) for 1d4 rounds and completely dispels any darkness spells of 6th level or lower whose source is within its area.

\ **14th Level**\ : The wearer grows a pair of gossamer wings. The wings are delicate and weak, carrying the wearer only with difficulty. She gains a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability).

\ **16th Level**\ : The wearer's wings grow stronger, more agile, and more beautiful, and iridescent patterns trace along them. Her fly speed increases to 60 feet (good maneuverability), and she gains a +5 competence bonus on :ref:`Fly <corerulebook.skills.fly#fly>`\  checks.

\ **18th Level**\ : The wearer gains a small domain in the fey realm. She can access her domain from any location, creating a silvery gateway. Treat her domain as a \ *mage's magnificent mansion*\ except that its size equals 20 10-foot cubes/level, the domain appears as wilderness instead of a mansion, and the servants are tiny fey instead of nearly transparent liveried servants.

\ **20th Level**\ : The wearer's type changes to fey, and she gains DR 10/cold iron. If the wearer's type was already fey and she already possessed DR/cold iron, her DR increases by 10 and magic weapons with enhancement bonuses of +3 or greater do not count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing her DR.

The wearer of these ornate crystal lenses gains a +6 competence bonus on :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks. When she uses :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  to determine whether someone is lying to her, she gets a brief flash of the liar's thoughts at that instant.

\ **9th Level**\ : When the wearer concentrates, she can perceive the thoughts of a single creature as writing in the air, rendered in the subject's native language. This functions as though the wearer had concentrated on the creature for 3 rounds using :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts#detect_thoughts>`\ , and can be blocked with a successful Will save with a DC equal to the wearer's character level + 6 (to a maximum DC of 20). A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected again for 24 hours. Maintaining concentration requires a standard action each round (as for a spell), and once the wearer ceases concentrating on a creature, she cannot observe thoughts again for 1 minute. This ability can be used for a total of 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. The glasses fail to function against creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower or without a written language.

\ **11th Level**\ : The competence bonus on :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks increases to +8. The :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts#detect_thoughts>`\  effect can be used for 10 minutes per day. In addition to seeing the creature's thoughts in its native language, the wearer gets visual impressions of the creature's thoughts. She might see the face of someone the creature is thinking about, for instance, or see an image of that creature stabbing someone if it's planning an attack.

\ **13th Level**\ : The competence bonus on :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  checks increases to +10. The :ref:`detect thoughts <corerulebook.spells.detectthoughts#detect_thoughts>`\  effect is constant—the wearer no longer needs to concentrate to maintain it, and there is no longer a limit on the number of rounds per day.

When touched to an eye, this star-shaped gem affixes itself until willingly removed or pried from an unconscious wearer. On command, the wearer can share her vision of her surroundings with allies within 60 feet. This gives them the benefit of any special visual sense she has (such as darkvision or :ref:`see invisibility <corerulebook.spells.seeinvisibility#see_invisibility>`\ ) and even allows blind allies to see, assuming the wearer is not herself blind. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and once used, can't be activated again for 30 minutes. While the effect is active, an ally of the wearer can switch back and forth at will between sharing the wearer's vision and seeing through his own eyes.

\ **12th Level**\ : The shared senses effect lasts for 10 minutes. While sharing senses, the wearer automatically discovers the number and location of secret doors in a 60-foot cone in front of her, as though she had been studying the area for 2 rounds with :ref:`detect secret doors <corerulebook.spells.detectsecretdoors#detect_secret_doors>`\ . (This effect doesn't grant any of the other benefits of :ref:`detect secret doors <corerulebook.spells.detectsecretdoors#detect_secret_doors>`\ .)

This spyglass grants enhanced vision of celestial bodies and the movements of the cosmos in the dark of night. Anyone looking through the spyglass gains a +5 competence bonus on skill checks to learn about the movements of the heavens or the constellations. These are typically :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (nature) checks.

\ **9th Level**\ : Objects viewed through the spyglass are magnified to 4 times their size instead of 2 times their size. This ability functions at all times, not just at night.

This garment is lined with gilded leaves, magically preserved in their autumnal splendor. The leaves retain this natural appearance in urban areas or natural settings other than forests or wooded areas. When the wearer is in a forest environment, the vest's leaves change to match the local flora. As long as the wearer moves no more than half her base speed in a given round, she gains a +4 bonus on :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks and can attempt :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks without cover or concealment. Each time the wearer attacks, the leaves turn blood red, negating this effect for 1 minute.

\ **11th Level**\ : Once per day, the wearer can either assume \ *tree shape*\ or transform herself into a cloud of leaves floating, falling, and swirling about in a mass the same size as the wearer's actual body. This leaf form is equivalent to \ *gaseous form,*\  but the wearer also gains vulnerability to fire. 

\ **13th Level**\ : The wearer can, in place of using either of the vest's 11th-level abilities, choose to release a number of leaves equal to 1/2 her Hit Dice as remote magical sensors. These leaves are identical in effect to \ *prying eyes,*\ except that they have vulnerability to fire.
