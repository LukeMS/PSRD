Nobles
#######
Lords and ladies of the land, rulers of nations, and famed personalities, nobles rise above the common folk as people of wealth, influence, and esteem. While the positions of many distance them from everyday folk, making them arrogant and aloof, others are philanthropists and heroes of the people who know the plight of the common man and seek to share their good fortune. The trappings and titles of nobility vary widely from nation to nation, and the barons and dukes of one country might equate to the pashas, denka, or ritters of the next.

Noble scions are the haughty and proud offspring of aristocratic sires, full of the fresh vigor of youth and all the hauteur of those born in a manor. They have received fine education and know a modicum of social graces, but typically practice them only when other highborn are present. Noble scions are scornful of commoners and vagabonds, who return the sentiment toward these peacocks strutting in their finery. 
If used as minor court functionaries and sycophants, noble scions can be sources of palace gossip and intrigue. They can also be used as experienced squires who have not yet risen to the knighthood, or as aristocratic cavalry.
A noble scion might be appointed to lead a lance of cavarly (CR 9). A pair of noble scions might dog the footsteps of a princess (CR 7), three noble scions could make up a knight's entourage (CR 8), or eight noble scions can form a gang of rakes with a noble (CR 10).

The knight can also grant a character entry into a tourney or a meeting with his liege with a +5 bonus on one :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\  check.
Knights are noble warriors, proud of bearing and lineage and yet humble in service to their liege. Though merciful and generous of spirit, a true knight is always ready to level lance or bare steel in pursuit of justice and to protect the innocent. Knights may also serve as local lord-stewards, judges, or fortress commanders. Knights are usually found singly or accompanied by a squire, escorting a pair of pilgrims (CR 8), guarding two nobles (CR 11), or leading a lance of four cavalry (CR 10).

A noble is a titled aristocrat of a noble house, whether a lesser branch or perhaps the high seat of the family line. A noble might also be a member of a royal family, probably not in line for the throne, but still with a high position in society. Whether baroness, countess, duchess, or margravine, a noble is proficient in all of the courtly arts (including with a fine blade) and is well acquainted with news, rumors, fashion, and etiquette in her lands and those that surround it. 
Nobles may serve as diplomats, high courtiers, appointed castellans or seneschals of royal castles, or even spies.
A noble may often be found with a knight bodyguard and three noble scions to show off at court (CR 10). A noble might also accompany two princesses in disguise (CR 10), while two nobles may be present at a celebrity bard's concert (CR 12). A traveling noble could be accompanied by a battle mage or minstrel (CR 9), or two watch captain bodyguards (CR 10).
