Ecology

\ **Treasure**\ none

Male lions are 5 to 8 feet long and weigh 330 to 550 pounds. Females are slightly smaller but use the same statistics.

Lions are usually the top animal predators in their territories, though they resort to scavenging if convenient or necessary. They may kill other predators (such as leopards and hyenas) that encroach upon their haunts, but rarely eat these kills unless game is scarce. Most lions do not selectively hunt humanoids, but occasionally one learns what easy kills they are and becomes a man-eater. 

Lions prefer plains but can adapt to living in shallow caves as long as there's a large and stable supply of prey to keep them fed.

Dire lions, known locally as spotted lions or cave lions, are immense predators that can grow up to 15 feet long and weigh up to 3,500 pounds. Although they are merely animals, these large creatures seem to take an almost sadistic glee in playing with and tormenting their prey before eventually devouring it. As a result, many tribes view dire lions as the spawn of evil gods, and hunt them down as soon as their presence in a region becomes obvious.
