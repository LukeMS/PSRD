Dominate Person
================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`dominate person <corerulebook.spells.dominateperson#dominate_person>`

The :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  DC to notice your target is dominated increases by double your tier. You can give orders to the target even if it's protected by non-mythic effects that block magical control, such as :ref:`protection from evil <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil#protection_from_evil>`\ . If the target is protected by a mythic effect, you can attempt to overcome this defense with a caster level check (DC 15 plus the caster level of the effect); add your tier to your roll and the opposing caster's tier to the DC. If the target succeeds at its Will save to break your control, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to force it to reroll the save and use the lower result.
