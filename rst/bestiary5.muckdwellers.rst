Special Abilities
==================

\ **Blinding Spray (Ex)**\  By filling its mouth with muddy water, a muckdweller can fire a concentrated stream of muck in a 10-foot line. A creature in the area must succeed at a DC 10 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d2 rounds. A muckdweller must spend a move action to refill its mouth with muddy water to use its spray again. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\ **Dextrous Swimmer (Ex)**\  A muckdweller moves through water gracefully. It uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier on Swim checks.

Muckdwellers have long tails that allow them to swim rapidly through the water or maintain their balance when standing upright. They sometimes associate with lizardfolk, forming allied settlements, but rarely living in the same community. Still they work and hunt together for mutual benefit. Most muck dwellers stand 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds.
