Rogue
######

Rogues are masters of misdirection and guile. Some revel in appearing to be something they're not, while others dabble in bolstering their trickery with alchemy.

Counterfeit Mage (Archetype)
*****************************

Charlatans and stage magicians use sleight of hand to fake magic. A counterfeit mage goes a step further, parroting the motions and phrases used by arcane casters to activate wands or other magical accoutrements. While counterfeit mages rarely fool a real wizard, their command of the arcane is enough to convince most lay people.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#magical_expertise`:

\ **Magical Expertise (Ex)**\ : At 1st level, a counterfeit mage adds 1/2 his level to :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  checks to disarm magical traps, :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  checks to find magical traps, and :ref:`Use Magic Device <corerulebook.skills.usemagicdevice#use_magic_device>`\  checks to activate scrolls and wands. A counterfeit mage can use :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  to disarm magic traps. This ability replaces trapfinding.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#signature_wand`:

\ **Signature Wand (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, a counterfeit mage can spend 1 hour practicing with a wand to designate it as his signature wand. He can draw that wand as a free action, and can activate it without having to succeed at a :ref:`Use Magic Device <corerulebook.skills.usemagicdevice#use_magic_device>`\  check. He can change his signature wand once per day. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#wand_adept`:

\ **Wand Adept (Ex)**\ : At 6th level, a counterfeit mage can use his Dexterity modifier in place of his Charisma modifier when attempting :ref:`Use Magic Device <corerulebook.skills.usemagicdevice#use_magic_device>`\  checks to activate wands.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#counterfeit_mage_rogue_talents`:

\ **Rogue Talents**\ : The following rogue talents complement the counterfeit mage archetype: :ref:`deft palm <ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.rogue#deft_palm>`\ , :ref:`esoteric scholar <ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.rogue#esoteric_scholar>`\ , :ref:`honeyed words <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#honeyed_words>`\ , major magic, minor magic, and trap spotter.

Underground Chemist (Archetype)
********************************

Underground chemists are part of the fetid underbelly of the alchemical world. While underground chemists can't hold a candle to dedicated alchemists, their use of alchemical substances and potions makes them tricky and dangerous. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#chemical_weapons`:

\ **Chemical Weapons (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, an underground chemist is able to retrieve an alchemical item as if drawing a weapon. She adds her Intelligence modifier to damage dealt with splash weapons, including any splash damage. She adds 1/2 her level to :ref:`Craft <corerulebook.skills.craft#craft>`\  (alchemy) checks. This ability replaces evasion.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#precise_splash_weapons`:

\ **Precise Splash Weapons (Ex)**\ : At 4th level, an underground chemist can deal sneak attack damage with splash weapons. The attack must be her first attack in that round, must qualify to be a sneak attack (such as an attack against a flat-footed target), and must be directed at a creature rather than a square. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level. 

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#discovery`:

\ **Discovery (Su)**\ : At 10th level, an underground chemist can select one of the following alchemist discoveries in place of a rogue talent: :ref:`concentrate poison <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.alchemist#concentrate_poison>`\ , :ref:`dilution <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.alchemist#dilution>`\ , :ref:`enhance potion <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.alchemist#enhance_potion>`\ , :ref:`extend potion <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.alchemist#extend_potion>`\ , :ref:`mummification <ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.alchemist#mummification>`\ , :ref:`nauseating flesh <ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.alchemist#nauseating_flesh>`\ , :ref:`poison conversion <ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.alchemist#poison_conversion>`\ , :ref:`preserve organs <ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.alchemist#preserve_organs>`\ , :ref:`spontaneous healing <ultimatemagic.spellcastingclassoptions.alchemist#spontaneous_healing>`\ , or :ref:`sticky poison <advancedplayersguide.baseclasses.alchemist#sticky_poison>`\ . She uses her rogue level as her effective alchemist level for determining the effects of her discoveries and whether she is able to select one. This ability alters advanced talents.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#underground_chemist_rogue_talents`:

\ **Rogue Talents**\ : The following rogue talents complement the underground chemist archetype: :ref:`black market connections <ultimatecombat.classarchetypes.rogue#black_market_connections>`\ , :ref:`fast fingers <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#fast_fingers>`\ , :ref:`lasting poison <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#lasting_poison>`\ , :ref:`sniper's eye <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#snipers_eye>`\ , and :ref:`swift poison <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#swift_poison>`\ .

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.rogue#underground_chemist_advanced_talents`:

\ **Advanced Talents**\ : The following advanced rogue talents complement the underground chemist archetype: :ref:`deadly cocktail <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#deadly_cocktail>`\  and :ref:`thoughtful reexamining <advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.rogue#thoughtful_reexamining>`\ .
