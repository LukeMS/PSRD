Special abilities
==================

\ **Gnaw (Ex)**\  Giant termites can burrow through earth and wood but not stone or metal. Their natural attacks and acid ignore hardness of 5 or less.

\ **Swarming (Ex)**\  Two giant termites can share the same space without penalty, and if both attack the same creature they are considered to be flanking that foe. Giant termites take no damage from termite swarms.

Giant termites are social, burrowing insects that create immense earthen mounds the size of cathedrals to house their large colonies. The colony splits into small groups to take on various tasks, like hunting food or collecting dirt and clay to expand the colony's mound. They are destructive pests, consuming plant matter and destroying wooden structures, but they consume meat as well if creatures interfere with their cycle of demolition and construction. Termites also use their acid to render animals into glue to reinforce the mound.
