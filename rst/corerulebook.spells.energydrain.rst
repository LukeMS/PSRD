Energy Drain
=============

\ **School**\  necromancy; \ **Level**\  cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  partial; see text for :ref:`enervation <corerulebook.spells.enervation#enervation>`

This spell functions like :ref:`enervation <corerulebook.spells.enervation#enervation>`\ , except that the creature struck gains 2d4 temporary :ref:`negative levels <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ . Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  saving throw (DC = \ *energy drain*\ spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ is removed. If it fails, that :ref:`negative level  <corerulebook.glossary#energy_drain_and_negative_levels>`\ becomes permanent.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4 Ã— 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
