Vishkanyas
###########

Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids with poisonous blood. Possessed of an alien beauty, these graceful humanoids see the world through serpentine eyes of burnished gold. Their supple skin is covered with tiny scales, often of a light green, which are sometimes arrayed in patterns not unlike those of a serpent. They cannot be generalized as good or evil, but since they truly speak with forked tongues, they are content to accept the gold they're offered and leave questions of morality to others.

##################

The following racial archetype is available to vishkanyas.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#deadly_courtesan_(rogue)`:

Deadly Courtesan (Rogue)
*************************

Skilled at manipulation and diversion, the deadly courtesan builds up those around her and periodically takes them down. She can be a spy, entertainer, assassin, bodyguard, or just an intimate to someone who needs it most. A deadly courtesan has the following class features.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#class_skills`:

\ **Class Skills**\ : At 1st level, a deadly courtesan adds :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (history) and :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (nobility) to her list of class skills and removes :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (dungeoneering) from her list of class skills.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#bardic_performance`:

\ **Bardic Performance (Su)**\ : At 2nd level, a deadly courtesan gains the bardic performance ability and the fascinate bardic performance. Her fascinate DC is 10 + 1/2 her rogue level + her Charisma modifier. She can use this bardic performance for a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. At each level after 2nd, she can use bardic performance for 1 additional round per day. If the courtesan also has bard levels, she may use these rounds for either class's fascinate bardic performance, and her bard and rogue levels stack for determining her fascinate DC. This ability replaces the rogue trick gained at 2nd level.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#inspire_competence`:

\ **Inspire Competence (Su)**\ : At 3rd level, a deadly courtesan can use her bardic performance to inspire competence. The bonus begins at +2 and increases by +1 for every six levels the courtesan has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 9th and +4 at 15th). This ability replaces all levels of trap sense.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#performance_strike`:

\ **Performance Strike (Sp)**\ : At 8th level, as a swift action, a deadly courtesan may expend rounds of bardic performance to gain a morale bonus on one attack roll. The amount of the bonus is equal to the number of bardic performance rounds expended (maximum bonus equal to 1/2 her deadly courtesan level). This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#rogue_talents`:

\ **Rogue Talents**\ : The following rogue talents complement the deadly courtesan archetype: finesse rogue, stand up (\ *Core Rulebook*\ ); charmer, coax information, fast fingers, honeyed words ; convincing lie, deft palm.

.. _`advancedraceguide.uncommonraces.vishkanyas#poison_tattoo`:

The tattoo temporarily boosts the strength of a vishkanya's natural poison, increasing the DC of the next weapon envenomed with the vishkanya's blood or saliva by +2 (once used, the tattoo is merely decorative and does not affect the creature's poison). A typical tattoo consists of intricate whorls and spiritual symbols on the hands or feet.
