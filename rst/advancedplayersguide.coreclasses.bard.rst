Bard
*****

A good bard can sing the birds from the trees or talk a king into abdicating his throne. A jack of all trades, the bard sees little need to restrict himself to a single talent, picking up a little of this and a little of that, but always with a keen eye for other people and how they might be manipulated, whether through artistic performances or more mundane avenues. Presented below are several classic bardic themes.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#arcane_duelist`:

Arcane Duelist
###############

A master of the martial applications of steel and spell, the arcane duelist blends both into a lethal combination. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#arcane_strike`:

:ref:`Arcane Strike <corerulebook.feats#arcane_strike>`\ : Arcane duelists gain :ref:`Arcane Strike <corerulebook.feats#arcane_strike>`\  as a bonus feat at 1st level. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#bardic_performance`:

\ **Bardic Performance**\ : An arcane duelist gains the following types of bardic performance.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#rallying_cry`:

\ *Rallying Cry (Su)*\ : At 1st level, an arcane duelist can use performance to rally dispirited allies. Each round he makes an :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  check. Any ally (including the bard) within 30 feet may use this check in place of his own saving throw against fear and despair effects. Those already under a fear or despair effect can attempt a new save each round using the bard's :ref:`Intimidate <corerulebook.skills.intimidate#intimidate>`\  check. Rallying cry does not work on effects that don't allow saves. This is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces countersong.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#bladethirst`:

\ *Bladethirst (Su)*\ : An arcane duelist of 6th level or higher may use performance to grant one weapon, one natural weapon, one end of a double weapon, or 50 items of ammunition of the same type within 30 feet a +1 enhancement bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 6th (maximum +5 at 18th level). These bonuses stack with existing bonuses and may be used to increase the item's enhancement bonus up to +5 or to add any of the following weapon properties: :ref:`defending <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_defending>`\ , :ref:`distance <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_distance>`\ , :ref:`ghost touch <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_ghost_touch>`\ , :ref:`keen <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_keen>`\ , :ref:`mighty cleaving <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_mighty_cleaving>`\ , :ref:`returning <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_returning>`\ , :ref:`shock <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_shock>`\ , :ref:`shocking burst <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_shocking_burst>`\ , :ref:`seeking <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_seeking>`\ , :ref:`speed <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#weapons_speed>`\ , or :ref:`wounding <corerulebook.magicitems.weapons#wounding>`\ . If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before adding special abilities. This performance replaces suggestion.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#mass_bladethirst`:

\ *Mass Bladethirst (Su)*\ : An arcane duelist of 18th level or higher can use his bladethirst performance to enhance the weapons of as many allies as desired within 30 feet. The bonus provided by this power is +4 if conferred on two allies, +3 for three allies, +2 for four allies, and +1 for five or more allies. The power granted to each weapon must be identical. This ability replaces mass suggestion.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#bonus_feats`:

\ **Bonus Feats**\ : An arcane duelist weaves might and magic in his combat style, gaining the following bonus feats at 2nd level and every four levels thereafter: 2nd level—:ref:`Combat Casting <corerulebook.feats#combat_casting>`\ , 6th level—:ref:`Disruptive <corerulebook.feats#disruptive>`\ , 10th level—:ref:`Spellbreaker <corerulebook.feats#spellbreaker>`\ , 14th level—:ref:`Penetrating Strike <corerulebook.feats#penetrating_strike>`\ , 18th level—:ref:`Greater Penetrating Strike <corerulebook.feats#greater_penetrating_strike>`\ . This ability replaces versatile performance and well-versed.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#arcane_bond`:

\ **Arcane Bond (Ex)**\ : At 5th level, an arcane duelist gains the arcane bond ability as a wizard, using a weapon as his bonded item, allowing him to cast any one addition spell that he knows once per day. He may not choose a familiar or other type of bonded item. He may use the hand holding his bonded weapon for somatic components. This ability replaces lore master.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#arcane_armor`:

\ **Arcane Armor (Ex)**\ : At 10th level, an arcane duelist gains Medium Armor Proficiency and can cast bard spells in medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure. At 16th level, he gains Heavy Armor Proficiency and can cast bard spells in heavy armor with no arcane spell failure. This ability replaces jack of all trades.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#archivist`:

Archivist
##########

Some bards greatly prefer academic pursuits to the drama (and sometimes melodrama) of their artistic brethren. 

\ **Bardic Performance**\ : An archivist gains the following types of bardic performance.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#naturalist`:

\ *Naturalist (Ex)*\ : An archivist who has identified a creature with a :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  check appropriate to its type can use performance to share strategies for defeating it with allies in combat. The archivist and any allies within 30 feet gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on attack rolls and saving throws against exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by creatures of that specific kind of monster (e.g., frost giants, not all giants or all humanoids). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. This language-dependent ability requires visual and audible components. This ability replaces inspire courage. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#lamentable_belaborment`:

\ *Lamentable Belaborment (Ex)*\ : At 6th level, an archivist can bewilder a creature already fascinated by his performance. Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours, but failure leaves the target either dazed or confused (archivist's choice) for as long as the performance continues. If the target takes damage, this effect ends immediately. This mind-affecting ability relies on audible components. This ability replaces suggestion. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#pedantic_lecture`:

\ *Pedantic Lecture (Su)*\ : At 18th level, an archivist can affect as many creatures with lamentable belaborment as he currently has fascinated. In addition, he may choose to cause targets to fall asleep rather than be dazed or confused. This ability replaces mass suggestion.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#lore_master`:

\ **Lore Master (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, an archivist may take 20 on :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  checks once per day, plus once per six levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces versatile performance.

An archivist can use :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  to disarm magical traps as per a rogue's trapfinding ability and gains a +4 bonus on saves against magical traps, language-dependent effects, and symbols, glyphs, and magical writings of any kind. This ability replaces well-versed.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#jack_of_all_trades`:

\ **Jack of All Trades (Ex)**\ : At 5th level, an archivist can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires him to be trained. At 11th level, he considers all skills to be class skills, and at 17th level he can take 10 on any skill check, even if it is not normally allowed. This ability replaces lore master. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#probable_path`:

\ **Probable Path (Ex)**\ : At 10th level, an archivist can calculate the action likely to bring success with the least risk. Once per day, he can take 10 on any d20 roll. He may use this ability one additional time per day for every three levels after 10th. This ability replaces jack of all trades. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#court_bard`:

Court Bard
###########

Spending years studying all of the finer points of erudition and etiquette, the court bard takes up the role of resplendent proclaimer and artist-in-residence at the hand of nobility, royalty, and the well-moneyed elite who aspire to join their ranks. 

\ **Bardic Performance**\ : A court bard gains the following types of bardic performance.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#satire`:

\ *Satire (Su)*\ : A court bard can use performance to undermine the confidence of enemies who hear it, causing them to take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a –1 penalty on saves against fear and charm effects as long as the bard continues performing. This penalty increases by –1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Satire is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces inspire courage.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#mockery`:

\ *Mockery (Su)*\ : A court bard of 3rd level or higher can subtly ridicule and defame a specific individual. The bard selects one target who can hear his performance. That individual takes a –2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks as long as the bard continues performing. This penalty increases by –1 every four levels after 3rd. Mockery is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that relies on audible components. This performance replaces inspire competence.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#glorious_epic`:

Glorious epic is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#scandal`:

\ *Scandal (Su)*\ : A court bard of 14th level or higher can combine salacious gossip and biting calumny to incite a riot. Each enemy within 30 feet is affected as if by a :ref:`song of discord <corerulebook.spells.songofdiscord#song_of_discord>`\  for as long as it can hear the performance. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect, and that creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Scandal is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces frightening tune.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#heraldic_expertise`:

\ **Heraldic Expertise (Ex)**\ : A court bard gains a bonus equal to half his bard level on :ref:`Diplomacy <corerulebook.skills.diplomacy#diplomacy>`\ , :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (history), :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (local), and :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  (nobility) checks (minimum +1). Once per day, the court bard can also reroll a check against one of these skills, though he must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. He can reroll one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. This ability replaces bardic knowledge. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#wide_audience`:

\ **Wide Audience (Su)**\ : At 5th level, a court bard can choose to affect a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot radius with bardic performances that affect an area. In addition, for every five levels beyond 5th, the area of such powers is increased by 10 feet (radius) or 20 feet (cone). If the power instead affects multiple creatures, it affects one additional creature than normal for every five levels beyond 5th. This does not affect powers that affect only a single creature. This ability replaces lore master and jack of all trades.

Detective
##########

Piecing together clues and catching the guilty with sheer cleverness, the detective is skilled at divining the truth.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#careful_teamwork`:

\ *Careful Teamwork (Su)*\ : A detective uses performance to keep allies coordinated, alert, and ready for action. All allies within 30 feet gain a +1 bonus on Initiative checks, :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\ , and :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  checks for 1 hour. They also gain a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saves and to AC against traps and when they are flat-footed. These bonuses increase by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Using this ability requires 3 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires visual and audible components. This performance replaces inspire courage.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#true_confession`:

\ *True Confession (Su)*\ : At 9th level, a detective can use performance to trick a creature into revealing its secrets. Using this ability requires a successful :ref:`Sense Motive <corerulebook.skills.sensemotive#sense_motive>`\  check to see through a :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\  or notice mental compulsion. After 3 continuous rounds of performance, the target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. On a failed save, a liar inadvertently reveals the lie and the truth behind it. A creature under a charm or compulsion reveals the nature of its enchantment and who placed it (if the creature knows) and gains a new saving throw to break free from the enchantment. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. Using this power requires only 2 rounds of performance at 15th level, and 1 round of performance at 20th level. This performance replaces inspire greatness.

If they fail, they must cease using :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\ , unlock and open doors between themselves and the detective, and dismiss, suppress, or dispel if necessary magical effects that grant invisibility or any other form of concealment from the detective. As long as they can hear the performance, affected creatures may not attack or flee until they have eliminated every such effect, though they are freed from this compulsion immediately if attacked. Creatures in the area must make this save each round the bard continues his performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. This performance replaces inspire heroics. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#eye_for_detail`:

\ *Spell Suppression (Su)*\ : A 8th level, a magician can use performance to counter the spells of his foes. Once the bard begins using this performance, he tracks the number of rounds it has been in use. While performing, as an immediate action, he can attempt to counter any spell that he can identify using :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\ , so long as that spell's level is equal or less than the total number of rounds he has been performing spell suppression. The attempt to counter the spell is made as if using :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\ , using the bard's level as the caster level. If successful, the bardic performance immediately ends. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#metamagic_mastery`:

\ *Metamagic Mastery (Ex)*\ : At 14th level, a magician can use performance to apply a metamagic feat to a spell he is about to cast without increasing the casting time. The bard must still expend a higher-level slot to cast this spell. This causes the performance to immediately end. This ability requires audible components.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#expanded_repertoire`:

\ **Expanded Repertoire (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, a magician can add one spell to his spells known from the spell list of any arcane spellcasting class. The spell must be of a level he can cast. This ability replaces versatile performance. 

\ **Arcane Bond (Ex)**\ : At 5th level, a magician gains the arcane bond ability as a wizard. He may not choose a familiar or a weapon as a bonded item. This ability replaces lore master.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#wand_mastery`:

\ **Wand Mastery (Ex)**\ : At 10th level, when a magician uses a wand containing a spell on his spell list, he uses his Charisma bonus to set the wand's save DC. At 16th level, when using such a wand, he uses his caster level in place of the wand's caster level. This ability replaces jack of all trades.

Sandman
########

Combining performance with stealth, trickery, and guile, the sandman uses cleverness to keep others off-balance.

\ **Bardic Performance**\ : A sandman gains the following types of bardic performance.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#stealspell`:

\ *Stealspell (Su)*\ : A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add them to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch attack as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts to its original owner. This ability requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#slumber_song`:

\ *Slumber Song (Sp)*\ : At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep (as :ref:`deep slumber <corerulebook.spells.deepslumber#deep_slumber>`\ , but with no HD limit). Otherwise, this ability functions like suggestion. This performance replaces suggestion.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#dramatic_subtext`:

\ *Dramatic Subtext (Su)*\ : At 9th level, a sandman can use bardic performance to cast spells without obvious visual or audible components while retaining the spell's normal effects. Observers must succeed at a :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  check opposed by a sandman's :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\  check to notice that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected and the performance ends. This ability replaces inspire greatness.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#greater_stealspell`:

\ *Greater Stealspell (Su)*\ : A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a target fails a save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can then choose which spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce the target's SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately reverts back to its owner. This performance replaces inspire heroics.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#mass_slumber_song`:

\ *Mass Slumber Song (Sp)*\ : At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions like :ref:`mass suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion_mass>`\ . This performance replaces :ref:`mass suggestion <corerulebook.spells.suggestion#suggestion_mass>`\ .

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#spell_catching`:

\ *Spell Catching (Su)*\ : At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's original caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell's level, even if the check fails. This performance replaces deadly performance. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#master_of_deception`:

\ **Master of Deception (Ex)**\ : A sandman gains a bonus equal to half his level on :ref:`Bluff <corerulebook.skills.bluff#bluff>`\ , :ref:`Sleight of Hand <corerulebook.skills.sleightofhand#sleight_of_hand>`\ , and :ref:`Stealth <corerulebook.skills.stealth#stealth>`\  checks. He may also disarm magical traps with :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  as a rogue's trapfinding ability. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#sneakspell`:

\ **Sneakspell (Ex)**\ : At 2nd level, a sandman adds +1 to the save DC of spells and bardic performance against opponents who are denied their Dex bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 18th level.

Far from civilization, furious tribes have their own war-singers, work-chanters, and lore-keepers, savaging enemies with song and sword alike.

\ **Bardic Performance**\ : A savage skald gains the following types of bardic performance.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#inspiring_blow`:

\ *Inspiring Blow (Su)*\ : A savage skald roars his war-cries with each telling blow. When he confirms a critical hit, he can start this performance as an immediate action (ending any other performances). He gains temporary hit points equal to his Charisma modifier (if positive), and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on their next attack roll prior to the start of his next turn. These temporary hit points remain until the bard ends his performance. This performance replaces fascinate. 

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#incite_rage`:

Incite :ref:`Rage <corerulebook.spells.rage#rage>`\  (Su): At 6th level, a savage skald can induce a furious rage in one creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as a :ref:`rage <corerulebook.spells.rage#rage>`\  spell that lasts as long as the target can hear the bard's performance; however, unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The bard cannot target himself with this ability. If the target has the rage class feature, it can instead immediately rage and stay in this rage without consuming rounds of rage per day as long as the bard continues performing. This mind-affecting effect requires audible components. This performance replaces suggestion.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#song_of_the_fallen`:

\ *Song of the Fallen (Sp)*\ : At 10th level, a savage skald can duplicate the effect of a \ *horn of Valhalla*\ . This effect requires 10 continuous rounds of performance and summons barbarians as a silver horn at 10th level, as a brass horn at 13th level, as a bronze horn at 16th level, and as an iron horn at 19th level.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#sea_shanty`:

\ *Sea Shanty (Su)*\ : A sea singer learns to counter seasickness and exhaustion during long sea voyages. Each round of a sea shanty, he makes a :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  skill check. Allies within 30 feet (including the sea singer) may use his :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  check in place of a saving throw against becoming exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, or sickened; if already under such an effect, a new save is allowed each round of the sea shanty, using the bard's :ref:`Perform <corerulebook.skills.perform#perform>`\  check for the save. A sea shanty has no effect on instantaneous effects or effects that do not allow saves. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces countersong.

.. _`advancedplayersguide.coreclasses.bard#still_water`:

\ *Still Water (Su)*\ : At 3rd level, a sea singer can use performance to calm rough waters within 30 feet, reducing the DC for :ref:`Profession <corerulebook.skills.profession#profession>`\  (sailor) and :ref:`Swim <corerulebook.skills.swim#swim>`\  checks, as well as for :ref:`Acrobatics <corerulebook.skills.acrobatics#acrobatics>`\  and :ref:`Climb <corerulebook.skills.climb#climb>`\  checks aboard ship, by an amount equal to the bard's level (to a minimum of DC 10) for as long he continues to perform.

Using this ability requires 1 round of continuous performance per level of the spell (as if he were a druid). These effects continue for as long as the bard continues performing (the effects on \ *control weather*\  happen immediately), but not longer than the spell's normal duration.

The enemy loses the attack that targeted the bard, but may spend additional attacks targeting other creatures. If the opponent was targeting the street performer with a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check at the same DC or lose the spell. If this check succeeds, it may target another creature with the spell instead. This mind-affecting ability requires audible or visual components. This performance replaces inspire competence.
