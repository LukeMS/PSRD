You imbue an object with psychic energy. The \ *node of blasting*\  unleashes a mental blast when a creature with a mind touches the object, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the creature touching the object and causing the creature to be staggered for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered condition.

Magic traps such as \ *node of blasting*\  are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  to thwart \ *node of blasting*\ . The DCs to find a \ *node of blasting*\  using :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  and to disable it using :ref:`Disable Device <corerulebook.skills.disabledevice#disable_device>`\  are both equal to 25 + the spell's level. Additionally, a creature with the read aura occult skill unlock can attempt the same :ref:`Perception <corerulebook.skills.perception#perception>`\  check to notice a \ *node of blasting*\ .
