Dispel Evil
============

\ **School**\  abjuration [good]; \ **Level**\  cleric 5, paladin 4

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, DF

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target or Targets**\  you and a touched evil creature from another plane, or you and an enchantment or evil spell on a touched creature or object

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level or until discharged, whichever comes first 

\ **Saving Throw**\  see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  see text

Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has three effects.

First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  save (:ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by :ref:`dispel magic <corerulebook.spells.dispelmagic#dispel_magic>`\  also can't be dispelled by \ *dispel evil*\ . Saving throws and :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.
