Euphoric Cloud
===============

\ **School**\  conjuration (creation) [poison]; \ **Level**\  druid 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (rare mushrooms worth 5 gp)

\ **Range**\  medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Effect**\  fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level

\ **Saving Throw**\  Fortitude negates (see text); \ **Spell Resistance**\  no

You create a bank of fog similar to that created by :ref:`fog cloud <corerulebook.spells.fogcloud>`\  except its vapors are intoxicating. Living creatures in the cloud become fascinated. This condition lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.
