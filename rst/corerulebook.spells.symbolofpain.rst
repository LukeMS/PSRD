Symbol of Pain
===============

\ **School**\  necromancy [evil]; \ **Level**\  cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

This spell functions like :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , except that each creature within the radius of a \ *symbol of pain*\ instead suffers wracking pains that impose a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike :ref:`symbol of death <corerulebook.spells.symbolofdeath#symbol_of_death>`\ , \ *symbol of pain*\ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \ *symbol of pain*\ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

\ *Note*\ : Magic traps such as \ *symbol of pain*\ are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for \ *symbol of pain*\ .
