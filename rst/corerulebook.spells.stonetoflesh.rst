Stone to Flesh
===============

\ **School**\  transmutation; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 6

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, M (a drop of blood mixed with earth)

\ **Range**\ medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\ **Target**\  one :ref:`petrified <corerulebook.glossary#petrified>`\  creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\  :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  negates (object); see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

This spell restores a :ref:`petrified <corerulebook.glossary#petrified>`\  creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 :ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save to survive the process. Any :ref:`petrified <corerulebook.glossary#petrified>`\  creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example, this spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.
