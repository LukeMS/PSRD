Feats
######

Feats represent special tricks or abilities a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his birth. They grant characters abilities that others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some feats specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most are available to anyone who meets the prerequisites. This section introduces two new types of feats—grit feats and style feats. Grit feats expand a gunslinger's ability to use grit and deeds, while style feats each grant a style of martial arts that can be used by monks and other characters who learn the style.

Types of Feats
###############

While most of the feats presented here are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to a type or types of feats that feature special shared rules. The type or types a feat belongs to appear in parentheses after the feat name. This chapter features the following types of feats. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#combat_feats`:

Combat Feats
*************

Fighters and gunslingers can select combat feats as bonus feats. Member of other classes can take these feats as long as they meet the prerequisites. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#critical_feats`:

Critical Feats
***************

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an additional condition on the victim. Characters without the :ref:`Critical Mastery <corerulebook.feats#critical_mastery>`\  feat can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide which feat to apply after confirming a critical hit.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#grit_feats`:

Grit Feats
***********

Grit feats interact with the gunslinger's grit class ability or the grit granted by the :ref:`Amateur Gunslinger <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#amateur_gunslinger>`\  feat, usually by adding to her set of deeds. Sometimes these feats increase the number of grit points a character has or how that character regains grit points. Gunslingers can take grit feats as bonus feats. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#metamagic_feats`:

Metamagic Feats
****************

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#performance_feats`:

Performance Feats
******************

Performance feats are used when you make a performance combat check, typically granting a special action that occurs when you make that check. Unless you have the Masterful Display feat, you can only apply the effect of one performance feat to each performance combat check you make. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#style_feats`:

Style Feats
************

For centuries, great warriors have looked to nature and the multiverse to find inspiration in battle. Countless monastic and contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to practitioners the world over.

As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you spend a swift action to switch to a different combat style. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while in the stance of the associated style. For example, if you have feats associated with Mantis Style and Tiger Style, you can use a swift action to adopt Tiger Style at the start of one turn, and then can use other feats that have Tiger Style as a prerequisite. By using another swift action at the start of your next turn, you could adopt Mantis Style and use other feats that have Mantis Style as a prerequisite.

The styles presented follow, along with specific feat paths—feats that complement each style.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#boar_style_feats`:

\ **Boar Style**\ : A tribe of orcs who disdained the use of weapons originally developed this savage unarmed fighting style. They preferred to slaughter their enemies with their bare hands and teeth. Over the centuries, a variety of races have adopted the Boar Style, most notably goblinoids, ogres, and trolls. The objective of the Boar Style is to attack with as much viciousness and cruelty as possible in order to break enemy morale. Fanatical followers of the style use herbal and alchemical reagents to harden their nails and teeth, sometimes performing self-mutilating procedures that result in clawlike nails and sharpened teeth.

\ *Feat Path*\ : :ref:`Boar Style,  <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#boar_style>`\ :ref:`Boar Ferocity <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#boar_ferocity>`\ , :ref:`Boar Shred <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#boar_shred>`\ .

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#janni_style_feats`:

\ **Janni Style**\ : This style, originating humbly from the folk traditions of disparate peoples, represents several similar unarmed fighting arts practiced around the world. Regardless of variations in technique, all practitioners have a fluid fighting stance that emphasizes rapid, powerful kicks.

Teamwork grant significant bonuses but only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even when their allies do not have the feats.

You can use a whip to make combat maneuvers with ease.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : :ref:`Improved Whip Mastery <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#improved_whip_mastery>`\ , :ref:`Weapon Focus <corerulebook.feats#weapon_focus>`\  (whip), :ref:`Whip Mastery <ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#whip_mastery>`\ , base attack bonus +8.

\ **Benefit**\ : You are so quick with your whip that you never drop it due to a failed disarm or trip combat maneuver attempt. Further, you gain the ability to grapple using your whip. To do so, use the normal grapple rules with the following changes.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#attack`:

\ *Attack*\ : You cannot use your whip to attack while you are using it to grapple an opponent.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#damage`:

\ *Damage*\ : When dealing damage to your grappled opponent, you deal your whip's weapon damage rather than your unarmed strike damage. 

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#free_hands`:

\ *Free Hands*\ : You take no penalty on your combat maneuver check for having fewer than two hands free when you use your whip to grapple.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#reach`:

\ *Reach*\ : Rather than pulling your grappled opponent adjacent to you when you successfully grapple and when you move the grapple, you must keep him within your whip's reach minus his own reach to maintain the grapple. If the difference in reach is less than 0, such as is the case for a Medium whip wielder and a Gargantuan creature, you cannot grapple that opponent with your whip. If you have to pull a creature adjacent to you to grapple it with your whip, you still provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent unless you have the :ref:`Improved Grapple <corerulebook.feats#improved_grapple>`\  feat.

.. _`ultimatecombat.ultimatecombatfeats#tie_up`:

\ *Tie Up*\ : While adjacent to your opponent, you can attempt to use your whip to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you have grappled rather than pinned, you take only a –5 penalty on the combat maneuver check rather than the normal –10.
