Surmount Affliction
====================

\ **Source**\  :ref:`surmount affliction <ultimatemagic.spells.surmountaffliction#surmount_affliction>`

You can cast this spell with no verbal or somatic component, and even if you're helpless (but not unconscious). You temporarily overcome a number of additional harmful conditions equal to half your tier.

\ **Augmented (7th)**\ : If you expend three uses of mythic power, you become immune to all afflictions the spell can normally overcome. In addition, you overcome (but do not become immune to) one of the following conditions: exhausted, nauseated, panicked, petrified, staggered, and stunned.
