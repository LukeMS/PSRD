\ *Shield*\ creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates :ref:`magic missile <corerulebook.spells.magicmissile#magic_missile>`\  attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\ . This bonus applies against :ref:`incorporeal <corerulebook.glossary#incorporeal>`\  touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The \ *shield*\ has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
