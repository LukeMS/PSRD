Cleric
#######

The common cleric shields his soul in faith and his body in armor, but there are those clerics who choose to rely on the power of faith alone as their defense.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.cleric#ecclesitheurge_(archetype)`:

Ecclesitheurge (Archetype)
***************************

Eschewing physical armor for the protection of his faith, an ecclesitheurge focuses on the miracles his deity bestows and the breadth of that deity's dominion.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.cleric#ecclesitheurge_proficiencies`:

\ **Weapon and Armor Proficiency**\ : An ecclesitheurge is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but he's not proficient with any type of armor or shield. This ability replaces the cleric's weapon and armor proficiency.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.cleric#ecclesitheurges_vow`:

\ **Ecclesitheurge's Vow**\ : At 1st level, an ecclesitheurge makes a vow to his deity to protect himself solely with his faith, not with armor or shields. An ecclesitheurge who wears armor or uses a shield is unable to use his blessing of the faithful ability, to use cleric domain powers, or to cast cleric spells.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.cleric#blessing_of_the_faithful`:

\ **Blessing of the Faithful (Su)**\ : As a standard action, the ecclesitheurge can bless one ally within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). A blessed ally gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus (depending on whether the ecclesitheurge channels positive or negative energy) on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, or saving throws or to AC until the ecclesitheurge's next turn. The ecclesitheurge can expend 1 use of channel energy when activating this ability to increase the duration to a number of rounds equal to the number of dice of his channel energy.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.cleric#domain_mastery`:

\ **Domain Mastery**\ : At 1st level, when an ecclesitheurge chooses his cleric domains, he designates one as his primary domain and the other as his secondary domain. An ecclesitheurge can use his non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from his primary domain's spell list.

Each day when he prepares spells, an ecclesitheurge can select a different domain granted by his deity and gain access to that domain's spell list instead of his secondary domain's spell list. He does not lose access to his secondary domain's granted powers or gain access to the other domain's granted powers.

This ability alters the domains ability.

.. _`advancedclassguide.classoptions.cleric#bonded_holy_symbol`:

\ **Bonded Holy Symbol (Su)**\ : At 3rd level, an ecclesitheurge forms a powerful bond with a holy symbol of his deity, which functions identically to a wizard's bonded object except it can be used to cast cleric and domain spells (instead of wizard spells) and the ecclesitheurge can grant his bonded holy symbol only magic abilities appropriate for a holy symbol or a neck slot item. 

As with a wizard's bonded item, an ecclesitheurge can add additional magic abilities to his bonded holy symbol as if he had the required item creation feat (typically :ref:`Craft Wondrous Item <corerulebook.feats#craft_wondrous_item>`\ ), provided he meets the feat's level prerequisite. For example, an ecclesitheurge with a bonded holy symbol who wants to add a wondrous amulet ability, like \ *amulet of natural armor*\ , to his bonded holy symbol must be at least 3rd level to do so. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities the ecclesitheurge added to the object, function only for the ecclesitheurge. If a bonded holy symbol's owner dies or the item is replaced, the object loses all enhancements the ecclesitheurge added using this ability. 

This ability replaces the increase to channel energy gained at 3rd level.
