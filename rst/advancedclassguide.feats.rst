Feats
######

Feats represent special tricks and edges that characters have acquired though training, luck, or a quirk of birth. They grant abilities and benefits in certain situations.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#types_of_feats`:

Types of Feats
***************

Though most of the feats presented in this chapter are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to one or more categories of feats that share special rules. A feat's type or types appear in parentheses after the feat's name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#combat_feats`:

Combat Feats
=============

Brawlers, fighters, gunslingers, swashbucklers, and warpriests can select combat feats as bonus feats. Members of other classes can take combat feats, provided they meet the prerequisites.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#panache_feats`:

Panache Feats
==============

Panache feats interact with the swashbuckler's panache class ability or the panache granted by the :ref:`Amateur Swashbuckler <advancedclassguide.feats#amateur_swashbuckler>`\  feat. Swashbucklers can take panache feats as bonus feats.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#style_feats`:

Style Feats
============

Style feats were introduced in \ *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat*\ . The style feats presented in this chapter are based on fighting styles more appropriate to the brawler's rough-and-tumble combat disciplines.

As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style that a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until either you use a swift action to switch styles or the end of the combat encounter, whichever occurs first. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while you are in the stance of the associated style.

The styles presented in this book follow, along with specific feat paths—feats that complement each style.

\ **Grabbing Style**\ : This discipline is a wrestling and grappling style that favors powerful one-handed grabs, fast repositioning of those grabbed, and the ability to move and damage one or two opponents.

\ *Feat Path*\ : Grabbing Style, Grabbing Drag, Grabbing Master.

\ **Jabbing Style**\ : This style favors rapid punches and kicks, typically while the fighter circles her foe. Many of these land in the same area, delivering more pain with each successive hit, or in debilitating areas of the body.

\ *Feat Path*\ : Jabbing Style, Jabbing Dancer, Jabbing Master.

\ **Pummeling Style**\ : Powerful and seemingly wild haymaker punches and extended kicks are the hallmark of this style. Deeply rooted in its martial philosophy is the concept that landing one mighty strike in the right area will send an opponent sprawling.

\ *Feat Path*\ : Pummeling Style, Pummeling Bully, Pummeling Charge.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#teamwork_feats`:

Teamwork Feats
===============

Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no benefits if the given conditions are not met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don't have those feats.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#feats_that_grant_extra_uses`:

Feats that Grant Extra Uses
============================

Feats that grant extra uses of class abilities, like Extra Channel or Extra Rage, effectively grant the affected ability a pool of additional uses each day. If you have levels in multiple classes that have the same ability (or abilities that are counted as others for the purposes of meeting feat prerequisites, like the skald's raging song counting as bardic performance), this single pool applies to all those abilities together, and doesn't grant extra uses to each one separately. You may spend this pool of uses each day on any of these abilities in whatever manner you choose.

For example, if you have levels in both barbarian and bloodrager and you take the Extra Rage feat, you gain 6 extra rounds that you can either use to rage or bloodrage or split between the two. The feat does not give both an extra 6 rounds of rage and 6 rounds of bloodrage—it gives you exactly 6 rounds each day that you can use for either one of these abilities. One day, you might use 4 of these rounds for rage and 2 on bloodrage; the next day, you might use 3 on each.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#feat_descriptions`:

Feat Descriptions
******************

The feats in this book are summarized on the :ref:`table below <advancedclassguide.feats#advanced_class_guide_feats_table>`\ . Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' descriptions for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

\ **Feat Name**\ : The line that bears the feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does. 

\ **Prerequisite**\ : This line lists a minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat can have more than one prerequisite.

\ **Benefit**\ : This benefit is what a feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated in the description.

\ **Normal**\ : This line clarifies what a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

\ **Special**\ : Additional unusual facts about the feat.

Your knowledge is more than plain smarts—it's inspired.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Int 13, 1 rank in at least one :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\  skill, no levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : Like an investigator, you have the ability to augment your :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\ , :ref:`Linguistics <corerulebook.skills.linguistics#linguistics>`\ , and :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  checks.

You can expend one use of inspiration as a free action to add 1d6 to the result of a :ref:`Knowledge <corerulebook.skills.knowledge#knowledge>`\ , :ref:`Linguistics <corerulebook.skills.linguistics#linguistics>`\ , or :ref:`Spellcraft <corerulebook.skills.spellcraft#spellcraft>`\  check, as long as you are trained in that skill (even if you take 10 or take 20 on that check). You make this choice after the check is rolled and before the result of the roll is revealed. You can use inspiration only once per skill check. Your pool of inspiration refreshes each day, typically after you get a restful night's sleep.

***************************

You know just where to strike to temporarily send your enemy into a confused stupor.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.

\ **Benefit**\ : Befuddling Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll—thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. An opponent who fails this saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt to use Befuddling Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.

****************

Your deity rewards you for your faithfulness and your steadfast worship.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Wis 13, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.

\ **Benefit**\ : When you take this feat, choose one domain granted by your deity. You can use the 1st-level domain ability that clerics of that domain can use a number of times or rounds per day, but you can use it only once per day or 1 round per day, whichever is appropriate. Your effective cleric level in regard to this ability is 1st level. If the domain has a 1st-level ability that does not meet this specification, you cannot use it. 

\ **Special**\ : You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity.

If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the :ref:`atonement <corerulebook.spells.atonement#atonement>`\  spell).

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#believers_hands`:

Believer's Hands
*****************

Thanks to your faith, you can heal others with a mere touch of your hand.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Wis 13, Believer's Boon, must be lawful good, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.

\ **Benefit**\ : Once per day, you can use the paladin's lay on hands ability. Your effective paladin level is equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). If you already have (or later gain) the lay on hands ability, you instead gain one extra use of lay on hands each day.

\ **Special**\ : This feat counts as having the lay on hands ability for the purpose of qualifying for feats such as Extra Lay on Hands.

If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the :ref:`atonement <corerulebook.spells.atonement#atonement>`\  spell).

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Base attack bonus +7, ability to cast 2nd-level bloodrager spells, bloodrage class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : While you are bloodraging, at the end of a charge you can expend a bloodrager spell slot as a swift action to imbue your charge attack with extra power. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell slot expended. This extra damage is force damage, and it's not multiplied in the case of a critical hit.

If your bloodline has a specific energy type associated with it (as the elemental or draconic bloodlines do), you can increase the damage to 1d8 points per level of the spell slot expended, and this extra damage is of that type.

.. _`advancedclassguide.feats#blessed_striker`:

Blessed Striker
****************

You attacks are augmented by the strength of your and your deity's shared alignment.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Base attack bonus +11, ability to cast divine spells, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.

\ **Benefit**\ : All of your attacks are treated as having whatever alignment components you and your deity share for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\ **Special**\ : If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the :ref:`atonement <corerulebook.spells.atonement#atonement>`\  spell).

*******************************

Arcane energy guides your devastating attack.

\ **Prerequisites**\ : Arcane Strike, ability to cast arcane spells, bloodrage class feature.

\ **Benefit**\ : While you are bloodraging, you don't need to spend a swift action to use your Arcane Strike—it is always in effect.

The blessing must be one that requires a standard action and affects one or more creatures. If the blessing would normally affect multiple targets, you affect only a single target. The target receives the blessing in place of the healing and any other effects of the channeled energy. (This application doesn't count toward your uses of blessings per day.)

\ **Benefit**\ : When you and your ally use Swap Places, your ally can be up to one size larger or smaller than you, and your movement into the ally's square does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
