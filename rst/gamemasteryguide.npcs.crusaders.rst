Crusaders
##########
Champions of righteous quests and agents in the direct service of deities, crusaders hunt the enemies of their faith wherever they lurk. While servants of holy groups might seek out cultists, witches, evil mages, and all manner of other heretics—on missions either righteous or misguided—the minions of foul divinities too might hunt down those who oppose their faiths. Whatever their association, crusaders are driven by their beliefs and can prove to be among the most devoted allies or fanatical enemies.

\ **Boon**\  A squire can make a personal introduction to a knight or help the PCs buy a combat trained mount or riding gear at a 5% discount. A squire might also agree to serve a fighter, paladin, or ranger PC, either for a limited time, or until granted knighthood.
Squires are aspiring knights, robust youths who train in skill at arms but also busy themselves with tending and caring for their master's gear, keeping it sharp, clean, and ready to use. Squires also learn the courtly arts and etiquette. After proving their loyalty and skill in battle, squires usually become knights. In lands where knighthood is only granted by a king or other monarch, some squires remain so for their entire lives.
Squires can be used as heralds, standardbearers, scouts, or royal messengers. They might also be used as skirmishers or light cavalry, or perhaps as the guards of a minor noble's manor house. A group of squires could also serve as a noble hunting party.
Simply giving a squire heavier armor can make a more formidable mounted combatant, while replacing the pick with a scimitar or longsword creates a nomadic horselord warrior. 
A squire often accompanies a knight (CR 7), or a pair of squires may accompany a noble scion (CR 3). Six squires can make a patrol of scouts or a hunting party (CR 3). Three squires can serve as outriders for a caravan, along with three caravan guards (CR 5), or six squires might work with a highwayman (CR 7).

\ **Boon**\  A holy warrior can accompany the PCs for up to 3 days on a mission consistent with his alignment or can send a squad of up to four temple guards (as guards) for 1 day.
Holy warriors are divinely sanctified and anointed warriors, raining death with bow and blade upon the forces of darkness and bringing hope and rescue to the desperate. Holy warriors are versatile combatants and could be masters of a temple or monastery. A holy warrior might command ten temple guards (as guards, CR 9), while a pair of holy warriors might escort a priest (CR 10). A half dozen could be a saint's honor guard (CR 13).

A saint is the embodiment of the crusader ideal. A saint might head a crusader temple or order or could be matriarch of her own religious tradition. A saint usually keeps a priest and holy warrior as advisors (CR 12), or a saint with a squad of four holy warriors might accompany a king (CR 15).
