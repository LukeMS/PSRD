Holy Aura
==========

\ **School**\  abjuration [good]; \ **Level**\  cleric 8

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

\ **Range**\  20 ft.

\ **Targets**\  one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

\ **Duration**\  1 round/level (D)

\ **Saving Throw**\  see text; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes (harmless)

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become :ref:`blinded <corerulebook.glossary#blinded>`\  when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to :ref:`AC <corerulebook.combat#armor_class>`\  and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike :ref:`protection from evil <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil#protection_from_evil>`\ , this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains :ref:`spell resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as :ref:`protection from evil <corerulebook.spells.protectionfromevil#protection_from_evil>`\  does.

Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a \ *holy aura*\ , the offending attacker is :ref:`blinded <corerulebook.glossary#blinded>`\  (:ref:`Fortitude <corerulebook.combat#fortitude>`\  save negates, as :ref:`blindness/deafness <corerulebook.spells.blindnessdeafness#blindness_deafness>`\ , but against \ *holy aura's*\ save DC).
