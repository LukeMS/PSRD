Grasping Hand
==============

\ **School**\  evocation [force]; \ **Level**\  sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as :ref:`interposing hand <corerulebook.spells.interposinghand#interposing_hand>`\ , except that it can also grapple one opponent you select. The \ *grasping hand*\  gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its :ref:`CMB <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_bonus>`\  and :ref:`CMD <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_defense>`\  for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its :ref:`Strength <corerulebook.gettingstarted#strength>`\  (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its :ref:`Dexterity <corerulebook.gettingstarted#dexterity>`\  is 10, granting no bonus on the :ref:`Combat Maneuver Defense <corerulebook.combat#combat_maneuver_defense>`\ ). The hand holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The \ *grasping hand*\  can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as :ref:`interposing hand <corerulebook.spells.interposinghand#interposing_hand>`\  does.
