Special Abilities
==================

\ **Gnaw (Ex)**\  When an aatheriexa shares the same square as a helpless creature, it can automatically deal 3d6 points of damage as a swift action by gnawing with its central maw.

\ **Float (Ex)**\  Aatheriexa can fly, though they must remain with 2 feet of a solid or liquid surface.

\ **Tentacles (Ex)**\  An aatheriexa's barbed eyestalk tentacles must all strike at a single target, but they do so as a primary attack. The tentacles deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and grant the aatheriexa a +8 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks.

\ **Withering (Ex)**\  An aatheriexa's tentacles secrete a toxin that causes flesh to swiftly rot and slough off the bone. A creature damaged by an aatheriexa's tentacles or constrict attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. This is a poison effect and the save DC is Constitution-based.

Aatheriexas were once a race of conquerors and slavers, but since the destruction of their homeworld, the survivors have wandered the cosmos. Exceedingly cruel, they find perverse pleasure in tormenting those they capture, using them as disposable bodyguards or subjecting them to sadistic magic experiments.

An aatheriexa's fleshy pink center is roughly 2 feet in diameter, and features a maw of gnashing teeth. Its grasping eye-tentacles hang down like the leaves of a weeping willow and extend its effective diameter to 5 feet. Aatheriexas weigh approximately 150 pounds.
