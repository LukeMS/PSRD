Bullet Ward
============

\ **School**\  abjuration; \ **Level**\  antipaladin 2, bard 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, F (one to four adamantine bullets, each worth 61 gp)

\ **Range**\  personal

\ **Target**\  you

\ **Duration**\  10 minutes/level or until discharged

You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover protectively nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The spell is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20.
