Plane Shift
============

\ **School**\  conjuration (teleportation); \ **Level**\  cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 7

\ **Casting Time**\  1 standard action

\ **Components**\  V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane of travel)

\ **Range**\  touch

\ **Target**\  creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands

\ **Duration**\  instantaneous

\ **Saving Throw**\ :ref:`Will <corerulebook.combat#will>`\  negates; :ref:`Spell Resistance <corerulebook.glossary#spell_resistance>`\  yes

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\  at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. :ref:`Plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\  transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting :ref:`plane shift <corerulebook.spells.planeshift#plane_shift>`\  again).
