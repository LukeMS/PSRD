Creating a Vahana
******************

Vahana is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature of the animal type. A vahana retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

\ **CR**\ : Base creature's CR + 2.

\ **Alignment**\ : Within one step of the vahana's creator deity.

\ **Type**\ : The creature's type changes to magical beast, and it gains darkvision 60 feet. Don't recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

\ **Armor Class**\ : Natural armor improves by 3.

\ **Defensive Abilities**\ : A vahana gains acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 10/magic, and spell resistance equal to CR + 11 (maximum 35).

\ **Speed**\ : +30 feet for all movement types (up to double the creature's base movement speed).

\ **Special Abilities**\ : A vahana gains the following.

\ *Blended Beast (Su)*\ : A vahana's creator blends animal features to strengthen the vahana. Each vahana gains one additional natural attack, with damage typical for its size (usually a bite attack). A vahana gains one additional form of movement speed at its new base speed, usually a swim speed or a fly speed. If it gains a swim speed, it gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious special quality, and the ability to grant its rider constant :ref:`water breathing <corerulebook.spells.waterbreathing#water_breathing>`\ . If it gains a fly speed, both the vahana and its rider benefit from constant :ref:`feather fall <corerulebook.spells.featherfall>`\  (in the rider's case, this includes when she falls off the vahana). Additionally, all vahana gain the :ref:`devotion special ability <corerulebook.classes.druid#companions_devotion>`\  of an animal companion.

\ *Rider Bond (Su)*\ : A vahana's bond with its rider allows them to communicate telepathically as long as they're on the same plane. As a free action that the rider can take even when it is not her turn, a vahana's rider can choose to redirect damage dealt to the vahana to instead affect the rider.

\ **Abilities**\ : Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +4, Con +4, Int +10, Wis +2, Cha +2.
