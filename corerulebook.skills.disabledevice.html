<p>You are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.</p>
<p><strong>Check</strong>: When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded.</p>
<p>The DC depends on how tricky the device is. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you trigger it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p>
<p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).</p>

<p id="corerulebook-skills-disabledevice-open-locks"><em>Open Locks</em>: The DC for opening a lock depends on its quality. If you do not have a set of thieves’ tools, these DCs increase by 10.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. A tricky or difficult device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. Attempting to open a lock is a full-round action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again</strong>: Varies. You can retry checks made to disable traps if you miss the check by 4 or less. You can retry checks made to open locks.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you have the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-deft-hands"><span class="std std-ref">Deft Hands</span></a> feat, you get a bonus on Disable Device checks (see <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats"><span class="std std-ref">Feats</span></a>).</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap’s DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it without disarming it. A rogue can rig a trap so her allies can bypass it as well.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: Characters with the trapfinding ability (like rogues) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>The spells <em>fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,</em>and <em>teleportation circle</em>also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. <em>Spike growth</em>and <em>spike stones,</em>however, create magic hazards against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
