<p>Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6.</p>

<span id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-class-features"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Class Features</a><a class="headerlink" href="#class-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following are the class features of the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a wizard’s movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-spells-wizard"><strong>Spells</strong>: A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spelllists.html#corerulebook-spelllists"><span class="std std-ref">Spell Lists</span></a>. A wizard must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.</p>
<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.combat.html#corerulebook-combat-saving-throws"><span class="std std-ref">saving throw</span></a> against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> modifier.</p>
<p>A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Wizard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> score (see <span class="xref std std-ref">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</span>).</p>
<p>A wizard may know any number of spells. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-bonus-languages-wizard"><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-arcane-bond"><strong>Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp)</strong>: At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a <a class="reference internal" href="#corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiars"><span class="std std-ref">familiar</span></a> or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for <a class="reference internal" href="#corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiars"><span class="std std-ref">familiars</span></a> are at the end of this section.</p>
<p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.magic.html#corerulebook-magic-concentration"><span class="std std-ref">concentration check</span></a> or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>
<p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see arcane school).</p>
<p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-item-creation-feats"><span class="std std-ref">item creation feats</span></a> and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats"><span class="std std-ref">Feats</span></a>). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.</p>
<p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-arcane-school"><strong>Arcane School</strong>: A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.</p>
<p>A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a <em>fireball</em>. In addition, a specialist takes a –4 penalty on any <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.usingskills.html#corerulebook-usingskills-skill-checks"><span class="std std-ref">skill checks</span></a> made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A universalist wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.</p>
<p>Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-cantrips-wizard"><strong>Cantrips:</strong> Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Wizard under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below).</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-scribe-scroll"><strong>Scribe Scroll</strong>: At 1st level, a wizard gains <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#scribe scroll (item creation)"><span class="std std-ref">Scribe Scroll</span></a> as a bonus feat.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-bonus-feats-wizard"><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-metamagic-feats"><span class="std std-ref">metamagic feat</span></a>, an <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-item-creation-feats"><span class="std std-ref">item creation feat</span></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#corerulebook-feats-spell-mastery"><span class="std std-ref">Spell Mastery</span></a>. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing those feats.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-spellbooks"><strong>Spellbooks</strong>: A wizard must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.readmagic.html#corerulebook-spells-readmagic-read-magic"><span class="std std-ref">read magic</span></a>, which all wizards can prepare from memory.</p>
<p>A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to his own (see <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.magic.html#corerulebook-magic"><span class="std std-ref">Magic</span></a>).</p>

<p>The abjurer uses magic against itself, and masters the art of defensive and warding magics.</p>
<p>Resistance <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-extraordinary-abilities-ex"><span class="std std-ref">(Ex)</span></a>: You gain resistance 5 to an energy type of your choice, chosen when you prepare spells. This resistance can be changed each day. At 11th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, this resistance changes to immunity to the chosen energy type.</p>
<p>Protective Ward <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-supernatural-abilities-su"><span class="std std-ref">(Su)</span></a>: As a standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius field of protective magic centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> modifier. All allies in this area (including you) receive a +1 deflection bonus to their <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.combat.html#corerulebook-combat-armor-class"><span class="std std-ref">AC</span></a>. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> modifier.</p>
<p>Energy Absorption <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-supernatural-abilities-su"><span class="std std-ref">(Su)</span></a>: At 6th level, you gain an amount of energy absorption equal to 3 times your wizard level per day. Whenever you take energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that amount. Any damage in excess of your absorption is applied to you normally.</p>

The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.</p>
<p><em>Skills</em>: For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master’s skill ranks, whichever is better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar’s total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar’s ability to use.

<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiar-share-spells"><em>Share Spells</em>: The wizard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on himself. A wizard may cast spells on his familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the familiar’s type (magical beast).</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiar-empathic-link">Empathic Link <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-supernatural-abilities-su"><span class="std std-ref">(Su)</span></a>: The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate empathically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link’s limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiar-deliver-touch-spells">Deliver Touch Spells <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-supernatural-abilities-su"><span class="std std-ref">(Su)</span></a>: If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.</p>

Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiar-speak-with-animals-of-its-kind">Speak with Animals of Its Kind <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-extraordinary-abilities-ex"><span class="std std-ref">(Ex)</span></a>: If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with other simians, rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and weasels with ermines and minks. Such communication is limited by the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.gettingstarted.html#intelligence (int)"><span class="std std-ref">Intelligence</span></a> of the conversing creatures.</p>
<p id="corerulebook-classes-wizard-familiar-spell-resistance">Spell Resistance <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.glossary.html#corerulebook-glossary-extraordinary-abilities-ex"><span class="std std-ref">(Ex)</span></a>: If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master’s level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar’s spell resistance.</p>

<p>Armor restricts the complicated gestures required while casting any spell that has a somatic component. The <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.equipment.html#corerulebook-equipment-armor-descriptions"><span class="std std-ref">armor and shield descriptions</span></a> list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.</p>
<p>If a spell doesn’t have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no arcane spell failure chance while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster’s hands are bound or he is grappling (although concentration checks still apply normally). The metamagic feat <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#still spell (metamagic)"><span class="std std-ref">Still Spell</span></a> allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell without the somatic component at one spell level higher than normal. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.</p>
