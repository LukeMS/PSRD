<p>The versatility of bards makes them threats in any battle. A combat-focused bard is a bit less of a jack-of-all-trades than others of his kind, but still backs up martial prowess with social skills and a healthy dose of arcane talent. Presented below are variant options for martially inclined bards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="archaeologist-archetype">
<span id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-archaeologist-archetype"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Archaeologist (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#archaeologist-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>No stodgy researcher, this archaeologist meets his research head-on in the field. Archaeologists sacrifice the bard’s inspirational performance for a smattering of rogue talents. This archetype also fits roguelike characters that focus more on learning than on stabbing foes in the back.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-bardic-performance"><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: Archaeologists do not gain the bardic performance ability or any of its performance types.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-archaeologists-luck"><strong>Archaeologist’s Luck (Ex)</strong>: Fortune favors the archaeologist. As a swift action, an archaeologist can call on fortune’s favor, giving him a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. Maintaining this bonus is a free action, but it ends immediately if the archaeologist is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. Archaeologist’s luck is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, effects, and the like that affect bardic performance. Like bardic performance, it cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, +3 at 11th level, and +4 at 17th level.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-clever-explorer"><strong>Clever Explorer (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an archaeologist gains a bonus equal to half his class level on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.disabledevice.html#corerulebook-skills-disabledevice-disable-device"><span class="std std-ref">Disable Device</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.perception.html#corerulebook-skills-perception-perception"><span class="std std-ref">Perception</span></a> checks. He can disable intricate and complex devices in half the normal amount of time (minimum 1 round) and open a lock as a standard action. At 6th level, an archaeologist can take 10 on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.disabledevice.html#corerulebook-skills-disabledevice-disable-device"><span class="std std-ref">Disable Device</span></a> checks, even if distracted or endangered, and can disarm magical traps. This ability replaces the versatile performance ability.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-uncanny-dodge"><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an archaeologist gains uncanny dodge, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>

<div class="section" id="daredevil-archetype">
<span id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-daredevil-archetype"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Daredevil (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#daredevil-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As quick at wordplay as at swordplay, daredevils are dashing heroes, inspiring their allies to match their clever repartee and acrobatic feats. Daredevils often lean toward comedy, dance, oratory, and singing.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-agile"><strong>Agile (Ex)</strong>: A daredevil adds half her class level (minimum 1) on <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.acrobatics.html#corerulebook-skills-acrobatics-acrobatics"><span class="std std-ref">Acrobatics</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.bluff.html#corerulebook-skills-bluff-bluff"><span class="std std-ref">Bluff</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.climb.html#corerulebook-skills-climb-climb"><span class="std std-ref">Climb</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.skills.escapeartist.html#corerulebook-skills-escapeartist-escape-artist"><span class="std std-ref">Escape Artist</span></a> checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>

<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-dauntless"><strong>Dauntless (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a daredevil gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, including all fear effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels gained after 2nd level, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="dervish-dancer-archetype">
<span id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-dervish-dancer-archetype"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Dervish Dancer (Archetype)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dervish-dancer-archetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Not all bards inspire others with their performances. Dervish dancers enter a near-mystical trance that allows them to push their bodies beyond normal limits.</p>
<p id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-weapon-and-armor-proficiency"><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Dervish dancers gain weapon proficiency with the scimitar and kukri. This ability replaces their proficiency with the rapier and whip.</p>

This works like bardic performance, except the dervish dancer only affects himself, and does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance. Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, effects, and the like that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does not benefit from the <a class="reference internal" href="advancedplayersguide.advancedfeats.html#advancedplayersguide-advancedfeats-lingering-performance"><span class="std std-ref">Lingering Performance</span></a> feat or any other ability that allows a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. Battle dancing benefits apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance, it cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities.</p>
<p>Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the dervish dancer to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a dervish dancer’s performance ends immediately if he is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A dervish dancer cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a dervish dancer can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action.</p>
<p>Dervish dancers gain the inspire courage, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics bardic performance types as battle dances, but these only provide benefit to the dervish dancer himself.</p>

He also gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. At 9th level, and every three bard levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses do not stack with the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.spells.haste.html#corerulebook-spells-haste-haste"><span class="std std-ref">haste</span></a> spell. This ability replaces suggestion and mass suggestion.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote id="ultimatecombat-classarchetypes-bard-razors-kiss">
<div><em>Razor’s Kiss (Su)</em>: At 8th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to improve his weapons’ critical range. All attacks he makes with manufactured weapons are treated as though he had the <a class="reference internal" href="corerulebook.feats.html#improved critical (combat)"><span class="std std-ref">Improved Critical</span></a> feat.
